<br /><span class="h2line2">WE MEET LIEUTENANT ALLERTON</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Sam, to making a stop at
Magdalena Bay?&rdquo; asked Uncle Naboth, as we
stood on the deck of the <i>Seagull</i>, anchored in
Golden Gate Harbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magdalena!&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;why, it&rsquo;s a wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but the torpedo fleet is
there, doin&rsquo; target practice, an&rsquo; Admiral Seebre
has asked us to drop some mail an&rsquo; dispatches
there, as well as a few supplies missed by the
transport that left last Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Admiral Seebre,&rdquo; I rejoined. &ldquo;That puts
a different face on the matter. We&rsquo;ll stop anywhere
the admiral wants us to.&rdquo; Merchantmen
though we are, none of us can fail in genuine
admiration for Uriel Seebre, the most typical sea
dog on earth&mdash;or on water, rather.</p>
<p>So we waited to ship the supplies and mail, and
by sunset were shrouded in golden glory as we
slowly steamed out of the harbor and headed
south.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty trip. Past old Santa Barbara, the
man-made harbor of San Pedro&mdash;the port of Los
Angeles&mdash;and along the coast of beautiful Coronado,
we hugged the shore line to enjoy the splendid
panorama of scenery; but once opposite the
Mexican coast we stood out to sea until, three
days afterward, we made Magdalena Bay and
dropped anchor amid the rakish, narrow-nosed
fleet of the torpedo flotilla.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t much to see at Magdalena. The
bay itself is fairly attractive, but the shore is uninteresting
and merely discloses a motley group of
frame and adobe huts. Yet here the Pacific
Squadron comes semiannually to practise target
shooting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>As it was four o&rsquo;clock when our anchor reeled
out we decided to lie in the bay until sunrise next
morning. We signaled &ldquo;mail and supplies&rdquo; and
two boats put out from the <i>Paul Jones</i>, the flagship
of the miniature but formidable fleet, and
soon boarded us. They were in charge of Lieutenant
Paul Allerton, whom we found a very
decent fellow, without a hint of that contempt for
merchantmen affected by so many Annapolis
fledglings.</p>
<p>We soon had the stores lowered&mdash;they were
not many&mdash;and delivered the mail pouch and dispatch
box, getting a formal receipt for them. As
supercargo and purser, I attended to this business
personally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to have met you, Mr. Steele,&rdquo; said
Lieutenant Allerton, &ldquo;and to have seen your
famous boat, the <i>Seagull</i>. We&rsquo;ve heard a good
deal of your curious adventures, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed, and Uncle Naboth Perkins, who stood
beside me, remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our days of adventure are about over, I guess,
Mr. Allerton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you bagged so much treasure you are
ready to retire?&rdquo; asked the officer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; replied my uncle. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been
tramps a long time, an&rsquo; sailed in many seas; but
the life&rsquo;s a bit too strenuous for us, so&rsquo;s to speak.
These boys o&rsquo; ours are reckless enough to git us
inter a heap o&rsquo; trouble, an&rsquo; keep us there, too, if
we didn&rsquo;t call a halt. So, seein&rsquo; as life counts for
more&rsquo;n anything else, Cap&rsquo;n Steele an&rsquo; I hev made
the youngsters turn over a new leaf. We&rsquo;re now
on our way to the Atlantic, &rsquo;round the Horn, an&rsquo;
perpose to do peaceful tradin&rsquo; from now on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allerton listened with thoughtful interest. He
seemed on the point of saying something in return,
but hesitated and then touched his cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be going, gentlemen. You know how
grateful we exiles are for the mail and tinned
stuff, and I tender the thanks of the fleet for your
courtesy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he went away and we considered the incident
closed.</p>
<p>We were a strangely assorted group as we congregated
on the deck of our beautiful craft the
<i>Seagull</i>, after dinner that evening, and perhaps
here is an excellent opportunity to introduce ourselves
to the reader.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Our ship, which we believe has been termed
&ldquo;the pride of the merchant marine,&rdquo; was constructed
under our personal supervision, and sails
or steams as we desire. It is about a thousand-tons
burden, yacht built, and as trim as a man-o&rsquo;-war.
It is commanded by my father, Captain
Richard Steele, one of the most experienced and
capable sailors of his time. He is one-third owner,
and I have the same interest, being proud to state
that I furnished my share of the money from funds
I had personally earned. Uncle Naboth Perkins,
my dead mother&rsquo;s only brother, owns the remaining
third.</p>
<p>Uncle Naboth is a &ldquo;natural born trader&rdquo; and a
wonder in his way. He isn&rsquo;t a bit of a practical
sailor, but has followed the seas from his youth
and has won the confidence and esteem of every
shipper who ever entrusted a cargo to his care.
He has no scholastic learning but is very wise in
mercantile ways and is noted for his sterling
honesty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>My father has a wooden leg; he is old and his
face resembles ancient parchment. He uses words
only for necessary expression, yet his reserve is
neither morose nor disagreeable. He knows how
to handle the <i>Seagull</i> in any emergency and his
men render him alert obedience because they know
that he knows.</p>
<p>I admit that I am rather young to have followed
the seas for so long. I can&rsquo;t well object to being
called a boy, because I am a boy in years, and experience
hasn&rsquo;t made my beard grow or added an
inch to my height. My position on the <i>Seagull</i> is
that of purser and assistant supercargo. In other
words, I keep the books, check up the various cargoes,
render bills and pay our expenses. I know
almost as little of navigation as Uncle Naboth,
who is the most important member of our firm
because he makes all our contracts with shippers
and attends to the delivery of all cargoes.</p>
<p>Over against the rail stands Ned Britton, our
first mate. Ned is father&rsquo;s right bower. They
have sailed together many years and have acquired
a mutual understanding and respect. Ned
has been thoroughly tested in the past: a blunt,
bluff sailor-man, as brave as a lion and as guileless
as a babe. His strong point is obeying orders
and doing his duty on all occasions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Here is our second mate, too, squatted on a coil
of rope just beside me&mdash;a boy a year or two
younger than I am myself. I may as well state
right here that Joe Herring is a mystery to me,
and I&rsquo;m the best and closest friend he has in all the
world. He is long and lanky, a bit tall for his age
and has muscles like steel. He moves slowly; he
speaks slowly; he spends hours in silent meditation.
Yet I have seen this boy in action when he
moved swift as a lightning bolt&mdash;not striking at
random, either, but with absolute intelligence.</p>
<p>Once Joe was our cabin boy, promoted to that
station from a mere waif. Now he is second mate,
with the full respect of Captain Steele, Ned Britton
and the entire crew. He wears a common
sailor suit, you&rsquo;ll notice, with nothing to indicate
his authority. When he is on duty things go like
clockwork.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>And now I shall probably startle you by the
statement that Joe is the rich man, the financial
autocrat, of all our little group. His bank account
is something to contemplate with awe and reverence.
He might own a dozen more expensive ships
than the <i>Seagull</i>, yet I question if you could drive
him away from her deck without making the lad
absolutely miserable. Money counts for little with
Joe; his associates and his simple if somewhat adventurous
life completely satisfy him.</p>
<p>Reclining at my feet is a burly youth rejoicing
in the name of Archibald Sumner Ackley. He
isn&rsquo;t a sailor; he isn&rsquo;t a passenger even; Archie is
just a friend and a chum of Joe&rsquo;s and mine, and
he happens to be aboard just because he won&rsquo;t quit
and go home to his anxious parents in Boston.</p>
<p>I fear that at the moment of this introduction
Archie doesn&rsquo;t show up to the best advantage.
The boy is chubby and stout and not exactly handsome
of feature. He wears a gaudy checked
flannel shirt, no cravat, yellowish green knickerbockers,
and a brown jacket so marvelously striped
with green that it reminds one of a prison garb.
I never can make out where Archie manages to
find all his &ldquo;striking&rdquo; effects in raiment; I&rsquo;m sure
no other living being would wear such clothes. If
any one ever asks: &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Archie?&rdquo; Uncle Naboth
has a whimsical way of putting his hand to
his ear and saying: &ldquo;Hush; listen!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>With all this I&rsquo;m mighty fond of Archie, and so
are we all. Once on a time we had to get used to
his peculiarities, for he is stubborn as a mule, denies
any one&rsquo;s right to dictate to him and is bent on
having his own way, right or wrong. But the boy
is true blue in any emergency; faithful to his
friends, even to death; faces danger with manly
courage and is a tower of strength in any encounter.
He sails with the <i>Seagull</i> because he
likes the life and can&rsquo;t be happy, he claims, away
from Joe and me.</p>
<p>And now you know all of us on the quarter
deck, and I&rsquo;ll just say a word about our two blacks,
Nux and Bryonia. They are South Sea Islanders,
picked up by Uncle Naboth years ago and devoted
now to us all&mdash;especially to my humble self. We&rsquo;ve
been together in many adventures, these ebony
skinned men and I, and more than once I have
owed my life to their fidelity. Nux is cabin master
and steward; he&rsquo;s the stockiest of the big fellows.
Bryonia is ship&rsquo;s cook, and worthy the post of chef
at Sherry&rsquo;s. He can furnish the best meal from
the least material of any one I&rsquo;ve ever known, and
with our ample supplies you may imagine we live
like pigs in clover aboard the <i>Seagull</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Our crew consists of a dozen picked and tested
men, all but one having sailed with us ever since
the ship was launched. We lost a man on the way
back from China a while ago, and replaced him in
San Francisco with a stalwart, brown-skinned
Mexican, Pedro by name. He wasn&rsquo;t one of the
lazy, &ldquo;greaser&rdquo; sort, but an active fellow with an
intelligent face and keen eyes. Captain Hildreth
of the <i>Anemone</i> gave us the man, and said he had
given good service on two long voyages. But
Pedro had had enough of the frozen north by that
time and when he heard we were short a man
begged to join us, knowing we were headed south.
Captain Hildreth, who is our good friend, let us
have him, and my father is pleased with the way
the Mexican does his work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>The <i>Seagull</i> was built for commerce and has
been devoted mainly to commerce; yet we do not
like the tedium of regular voyages between given
ports and have been quite successful in undertaking
&ldquo;tramp&rdquo; consignments of freight to be delivered
in various far-off foreign lands. During these
voyages we have been led more than once into
dangerous &ldquo;side&rdquo; adventures, and on our last
voyage Joe, Archie and I had barely escaped with
our lives&mdash;and that by the merest chance&mdash;while
engaged in one of these reckless undertakings. It
was this incident that caused Uncle Naboth and
my father to look grave and solemn whenever their
eyes fell upon us three, and while we lay anchored
in San Francisco harbor they announced to me
their decision to avoid any such scrapes in the
future by undertaking to cover a regular route between
Cuba and Key West, engaging in the tobacco
and cigar trade.</p>
<p>I did not fancy this arrangement very much,
but was obliged to submit to my partners and
superiors. Archie growled that he would &ldquo;quit
us cold&rdquo; at the first Atlantic port, but intended to
accompany us around the Horn, where there might
be a &ldquo;little excitement&rdquo; if bad weather caught us.
Joe merely shrugged his shoulders and refrained
from comment. And so we started from the
Golden Gate en route for Cuba, laden only with
our necessary stores for ballast, although our
bunkers were full of excellent Alaska coal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>The stop in Magdalena Bay would be our last
one for some time; so, being at anchor, with no
duties of routine confronting us, we sat on deck
enjoying the beautiful tropical evening and chatting
comfortably while the sailors grouped around
the forecastle and smoked their pipes with unalloyed
and unaccustomed indolence.</p>
<p>The lights of the near-by torpedo fleet were
beginning to glimmer in the gathering dusk when
a small boat boarded us and we were surprised to
see Lieutenant Allerton come on board again and
approach our company. This time, however, he
wore civilian&rsquo;s clothes instead of his uniform.</p>
<p>Greeting us with quiet respect he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I sit down, gentlemen? I&rsquo;d like a little
talk with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Steele pointed to a chair at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very welcome, sir,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>Allerton sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The despatches you brought,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;conveyed
to me some joyful news. I have been
granted a three months&rsquo; leave of absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he paused I remarked, speaking for us all:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are to be congratulated, Lieutenant.
Isn&rsquo;t that a rather unusual leave?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it is,&rdquo; he returned, laughingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been trying for it for nearly two years, and it
might not have been allowed now had I not possessed
an influential friend at Washington&mdash;my
uncle, Simeon Wells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simeon Wells!&rdquo; ejaculated Uncle Naboth.
&ldquo;What, the great electrician who is called &lsquo;the
master Wizard&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe my uncle has gained some distinction
in electrical inventions,&rdquo; was the modest reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Distinction! Why, I&rsquo;m told he can skin old
Edison to a frazzle,&rdquo; remarked Archie, who was
not very choice in his selection of words, as he
rolled over upon his back and looked up at the
officer wonderingly. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Wells invent the
great storage battery &lsquo;multum in parvo&rsquo;, and the
new aeroplane motors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Simeon is not very ambitious for honor,&rdquo;
said Mr. Allerton quietly. &ldquo;He has given the
government the control of but few&mdash;a very few&mdash;of
his really clever electrical devices. His greatest
delight he finds in inventing. When he has worked
out a problem and brought it to success he cares
little what becomes of it. That, I suppose, is the
mark of an unpractical genius&mdash;unpractical from
a worldly sense. Still, his relations with the government,
limited as they are, proved greatly to my
advantage; for when he found my heart was set
on this leave of absence, he readily obtained it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;The request of Simeon Wells ought to accomplish
much more than that, considering his invaluable
services,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that reason he has warned me he will not
interfere again in my behalf,&rdquo; answered Allerton;
&ldquo;so I must make the most of this leave. It is this
consideration that induced me to come to see you
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We remained silent, waiting for him to proceed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understood from what you said this afternoon
that you are bound for Cuba, by way of the
Horn,&rdquo; he resumed, after a moment of thought.</p>
<p>Captain Steele nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a fast ship, you leave immediately,
and you are going very near to my own destination,&rdquo;
continued Allerton. &ldquo;Therefore, I have
come to ask if you will accept me as a passenger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cast an inquiring glance at Uncle Naboth, and
after meeting his eye replied:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;We do not carry passengers, Lieutenant Allerton;
but it will please us to have you accept such
hospitality as we can offer on the voyage. You
will be a welcome guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flushed, as I could see under the light of the
swinging lantern: for evening had fallen with its
usual swift tropical custom. And I noticed, as
well, that Mr. Allerton seemed undecided how to
handle what was evidently an unexpected situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I wanted to take my man with me,&rdquo; he
stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your servant, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of our seamen, whose leave I obtained
with my own. He is a Maya from Yucatan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring him along, sir,&rdquo; said my father,
heartily; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all the same to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he returned, and then sat silent,
swinging his cap between his hands. Allerton had
a thin, rather careworn face, for so young a man,
for he could not be more than thirty at most. He
was of medium height, of athletic build, and
carried himself erect&mdash;a tribute to his training at
the Naval Academy and his service aboard ship.
There was something in the kindly expression of
his deep-set, dark eyes and the pleasantly modulated
tones of his voice that won our liking, and
I am sure we were sincere in declaring he would
be a welcome guest on the ensuing voyage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I have several boxes&mdash;chests,&rdquo; he said,
presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve room for a cargo, sir,&rdquo; responded
Uncle Naboth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what hour do you sail?&rdquo; inquired Allerton,
seeming well pleased by our consideration for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daybreak, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then may we come aboard to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any hour you like,&rdquo; said I. It was Joe&rsquo;s
watch, so I introduced him more particularly to
our second mate, as well as to the other members
of our party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we send for you, Mr. Allerton?&rdquo; asked
Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;The ship&rsquo;s boat will
bring me aboard, thank you. The boys are sorry
to see me go so suddenly, but I feel I must take
advantage of this fortunate occasion to secure
passage. I might wait here a week or two before
any sort of tub came this way, and I need every
minute of my leave. Cuba lies only a hundred and
twenty miles across the channel from Yucatan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>With this he returned to the torpedo boat he
served, and so accustomed were we to little surprises
of this nature that we paid small heed to the
fact that we had accepted an unlooked for addition
to our party for the long voyage that loomed
ahead of us. We were quite a happy family aboard
the <i>Seagull</i>, and Lieutenant Allerton appeared to
be a genial fellow who would add rather than detract
from the association we enjoyed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE LISTEN TO A STRANGE PROPOSITION</span></h2>
<p>I did not hear our passengers come aboard that
night, being sound asleep. By the time I left my
room next morning we were under way and steaming
briskly over one of those quiet seas for which
the Pacific is remarkable.</p>
<p>In the main cabin I found Lieutenant Allerton
sitting at breakfast with Captain Steele, Uncle
Naboth and Archie. Joe was snoozing after his
late watch and Ned Britton was on deck. Behind
our guest&rsquo;s chair stood the handsomest Indian I
have ever seen, the Maya he had mentioned to us
and whose name was Chaka. Our South Sea
Islanders were genuine black men, but Chaka&rsquo;s
skin was the color of golden copper. He had
straight black hair, but not the high cheek bones
of the typical American Indian, and the regularity
of his features was certainly remarkable. His
eyes were large, frank in expression and dark
brown in color; he seemed intelligent and observant
but never spoke unless first addressed, and
then in modest but dignified tones. His English
was expressive but not especially fluent, and it
was easy to understand that he had picked up the
language mainly by hearing it spoken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>My first glance at Chaka interested me in the
fellow, yet of course during that first meeting I
discovered few of the characteristics I have described.
At this time he was silent and motionless
as a statue save when opportunity offered to serve
his master.</p>
<p>The lieutenant wore this morning a white duck
mess costume for which he apologized by saying
that his civilian wardrobe was rather limited, and
if we would pardon the formality he would like to
get all the wear from his old uniforms that was
possible, during the voyage.</p>
<p>We told him to please himself. I thought he
looked more manly and imposing in naval uniform
than in &ldquo;cits.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see how he can be shy of clothes,&rdquo;
remarked Archie, after breakfast, as we paced the
deck together. &ldquo;Allerton lugged seven big boxes
aboard last night; I saw them come up the side;
and if they don&rsquo;t contain his togs I&rsquo;d like to know
what on earth they <i>do</i> hold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s none of our affair, Archie,&rdquo; I
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think this thing is all straight and
above board, Sam?&rdquo; asked my friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Archie. He&rsquo;s a lieutenant in the
United States navy, and has a regular leave of
absence. He joined us with the approval and
good will of his commander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know; but it seems queer, somehow. Take
that copper-faced fellow, for instance, who looks
more like a king than a servant; what has Allerton
got such a body guard as that for? I never knew
any other naval officer to have the like. And
three months&rsquo; leave&mdash;on private business. Suff&rsquo;rin&rsquo;
Pete! what&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might ask the lieutenant,&rdquo; I replied, indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s the boxes; solid redwood and
clamped with brass; seven of &rsquo;em! What&rsquo;s in
&rsquo;em, Sam, do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Archie boy, you&rsquo;re getting unduly suspicious.
And you&rsquo;re minding some one else&rsquo;s business.
Get the quoits and I&rsquo;ll toss a game with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our passenger was very quiet during the following
day or two. He neither intruded nor
secluded himself, but met us frankly when we
were thrown together, listened carefully to our
general conversation, and refrained from taking
part in it more than politeness required.</p>
<p>Joe thought the young fellow seemed thoughtful
and ill at ease, and confided to me that he had
noticed Allerton now made more of a companion
of the Maya than a dependant, although the man,
for his part, never abated his deferent respect.
Chaka seemed to regard Allerton with the love
and fidelity of a dog for its master; yet if any of
the sailors, or even Nux or Bryonia, spoke to the
Indian with undue familiarity Chaka would draw
himself up proudly and assume the pose of a
superior.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>We were much interested in the personality of
these two unusual personages&mdash;that is, Joe, Archie
and I were&mdash;and we often discussed them among
ourselves. We three boys, being chums of long
standing, were much together and had come to
understand one another pretty well. We all liked
Paul Allerton, for there was something winning
in his personality. As for the Indian, Chaka, he
did not repel us as much as he interested and fascinated
us. One night big Bry, whom we admitted
to perfect familiarity because of his long
service, said to us:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Maya no common Injun, Mars&rsquo; Sam, yo&rsquo;
take my word. He say his country Yucatan, an&rsquo;
that place Yucatan don&rsquo; mean nuthin&rsquo; to me, nohow,
&rsquo;cause I never been there. But, wherever it
is, Chaka&rsquo;s people mus&rsquo; be good people, an&rsquo; Chaka
hisself never had any other marsa than Mars&rsquo;
Allerton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been serving in the navy, Bry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That don&rsquo; count, sah. Yo&rsquo; know what I
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the evening of the third day out from Magdalena
we were clustered as usual upon the deck,
amusing ourselves by casual conversation, when
Lieutenant Allerton approached us and said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have a few moments&rsquo; confidential
talk with whoever is in authority here. It&rsquo;s rather
hard for a stranger to determine who that may
be, as you all seem alike interested in the career of
the <i>Seagull</i>. But of course some one directs your
policies and decides upon your business ventures,
and that is the person I ought properly to address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were a little puzzled and astonished by this
speech. Uncle Naboth removed his pipe from his
lips to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This group is pretty near a partnership, sir,
seein&rsquo; as we&rsquo;ve been through good and bad luck
together many times an&rsquo; learned how to trust each
other as brave an&rsquo; faithful comrades. We haven&rsquo;t
any secrets, as I knows on; an&rsquo; if so be you talked
in private to any one of us, he&rsquo;d be sure to call
a meetin&rsquo; an&rsquo; tell the others. So, if you&rsquo;ve
anything to say about the ship, or business matters,
or anything that ain&rsquo;t your own personal concern,
set right down here an&rsquo; tell it now, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll all
listen the best we know how.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Allerton followed this speech gravely and at
first appeared embarrassed and undecided. I saw
him cast a quick glance into Chaka&rsquo;s eyes, and the
Maya responded with a stately nod. Then the
lieutenant sat down in the center of our group and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, gentlemen, for your kindness. It
would seem that I have imposed upon your good
nature sufficiently already; yet here I am, about to
ask another favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, sir,&rdquo; said my father, with an encouraging
nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what I have been able to learn,&rdquo; continued
the lieutenant, in his quiet voice, &ldquo;your ship
is at this moment unchartered. You are bound
for Havana, where you expect to make a lucrative
contract to carry merchandise between that port
and Key West; mostly, of course, leaf tobacco.
Is that true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite correct, sir,&rdquo; said Uncle Naboth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, there is no harm in my making
you a business proposition. I want to land on the
east coast of Yucatan, at a place little known and
seldom visited by ships. It will take you a couple
of hundred miles out of your course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few moments no one spoke. Then Captain
Steele said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;A trip like that, Mr. Allerton, involves a certain
amount of expense to us. But we&rsquo;re free, as
far as our time is concerned, and we&rsquo;ve plenty of
coal and supplies. The question is, how much are
you willing to pay for the accommodation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slight flush crept over Allerton&rsquo;s cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I have very
little ready money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tone was so crestfallen that I felt sorry for
him, and Joe turned quickly and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s unlucky, sir; but I&rsquo;ve some funds that
are not in use just now, and if you&rsquo;ll permit me
to loan you whatever you require I shall be very
happy to be of service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or,&rdquo; added Uncle Naboth, carelessly, &ldquo;you can
pay us some other time; whenever you&rsquo;re able.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allerton looked around him, meeting only sympathetic
faces, and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is not business&mdash;not at all!&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;I did not intend to ask for financial assistance,
gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you intend, Mr. Allerton?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>He refrained from answering the direct question
at once, evidently revolving in his mind what
he should say. Then he began as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since I came aboard I have had a feeling
that I am among friends; or, at least, congenial
spirits. I am embarked on a most Quixotic adventure,
gentlemen, and more and more I realize
that in order to accomplish what I have set out to
do I need assistance&mdash;assistance of a rare and
practical sort that you are well qualified to furnish.
But it is necessary, in order that you understand
me and my proposition fully, that I should tell you
my story in detail. If I have your kind permission
I will at once do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It began to sound interesting, especially in the
ears of us three boys who loved adventure. I
think he could read the eagerness in our eyes; but
he looked earnestly at Captain Steele, who said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire ahead, Mr. Allerton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He obeyed, seeming to choose his words carefully,
so as to make the relation as concise as
possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;My home is in a small New Hampshire town
where the Allertons have been the most important
family for many generations. I was born in the
same room&mdash;I think in the same bed&mdash;that my
father and grandfather were born in. We had a
large farm, or estate, and a fine old homestead
that was, and is, the pride of the country. We
have until recently been considered wealthy; but
my poor father in some way acquired a speculative
passion which speedily ruined him. On his
death, while I was yet a cadet at Annapolis, it was
found that all the land and investments he had
inherited were gone; indeed, all that was left was
the homestead with a few acres surrounding it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother and my two maiden sisters, one a
confirmed invalid and both much older than I,
found themselves wholly without resources to support
themselves. In this emergency an old lawyer&mdash;a
friend of the family, who I imagine has
little keen ability in business matters, advised my
mother to mortgage the place to secure funds for
living expenses. It seemed really necessary, for
the three forlorn women were unequal to the task
of earning their living in any way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;When this first fund was exhausted they mortgaged
the homestead again, and still again; and
although they had lived simply and economically,
in twelve years the old place has become so
plastered with mortgages that it is scarcely worth
their face value. Little can be saved from a second
lieutenant&rsquo;s pay, yet I have been able to send
something to the dear ones at home, which only
had the effect of staving off the inevitable crisis for
a time. Uncle Simeon, too, has helped them when
he remembered it and had money; but he is a man
quite impractical in money matters and the funds
required for his electrical experiments are so great
that he is nearly as poor as I am. Very foolishly
he refuses to commercialize his inventions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conditions at home have naturally grown
worse instead of better, and now the man who
holds the mortgages on the homestead has notified
my mother that he will foreclose when next they
fall due, in about four months&rsquo; time from now.
Such is the condition of my family at home, and
you may well imagine, my friends, how unhappy
their misfortunes and necessities have made me.
As the climax of their sad fortunes drew near I
have tried to find some means to assist them. It
has occupied my thoughts by day and night. But
one possible way of relief has occurred to me, suggested
by Chaka. It is a desperate chance, perhaps;
still, it is a chance, and I have resolved to
undertake it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>He paused for a moment; but no one cared to
speak, although we were much interested in the
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine years ago,&rdquo; continued Lieutenant Allerton,
&ldquo;while I was ensign on the <i>Maryland</i>, we
were cruising on the east coast of the promontory
of Yucatan when one evening we observed a small
boat being sculled rapidly toward the ship by a
young native the color of bronze, who was naked
except for a loin cloth. After him darted a
motley crowd of boats, in hot pursuit, the occupants
screaming wild invectives at their escaping
prey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our captain ordered a gig lowered and I was
sent out in it, met the fugitive, and took him
aboard. We managed to regain the ship before
the frantic natives could reach us. However, they
shot a myriad of poisoned darts at us and were
only driven off when a volley from our men sent
them scurrying back to shore in a panic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;The young fellow I had rescued was Chaka.
He seemed to consider me his especial preserver
and attached himself to me with a persistency that
induced the captain to let me have him in my own
room, where we soon became friends. Chaka is
very intelligent, as you have doubtless observed.
I taught him English and he taught me the Maya
tongue. When, some months after, I was transferred,
I managed to take Chaka with me and have
him enrolled as a seaman. We have been together
nine years, and we are better friends than at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up at the Maya, who bowed gravely
in acknowledgment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE UNDERTAKE THE YUCATAN ADVENTURE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I have learned all of Chaka&rsquo;s history, as he
has learned all of mine,&rdquo; continued Allerton, resuming
his story. &ldquo;My friend is a royal prince of
the Itzaex, the one native tribe of Yucatan that
defied the Spanish invaders of the Sixteenth Century
and remains unconquered to this day. This
tribe dwells in the vast sierras of Yucatan, near
the Great Lake, and the Atkayma of the Itzaex
has the same importance and power as the Inca of
Peru or the Caciques of the Aztecs formerly enjoyed.
Chaka is the eldest son of the ruling
atkayma; by this time he may even have succeeded
to the title of atkayma himself, the head
of his people, for his father was an old man when
the boy left him. The family of rulers is a sacred
one, said to be descended from the sun, and every
one of the atkayma&rsquo;s fifty thousand subjects
would die for him without hesitation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;At the time I rescued Chaka he was an adventurous
youth who, ignorant of the name of
fear, was leading a band of his people on an expedition
to the seacoast, in search of turtles. In
some way he became separated from his companions
and found himself surrounded by a horde
of Mopanes, the hereditary tribal foes of the
Itzaex. I am sure the boy rendered a good account
of himself before he was forced to leap into
a boat and scull out to sea, where his sharp eyes
had noted our ship approaching. He had been
bred with a horror for the white man, but preferred
to take his chances with us rather than be
cut down by the Mopanes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he came to know us, and to understand
our advanced civilization, the youth decided that
he preferred it to the wild, crude life of his own
people, and has gladly sacrificed his royal heritage
to remain with me. Our friendship has been very
sweet to us both, and we are as brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was good to watch the Maya&rsquo;s face during
this tribute. His pride in his friend and his devotion
to him might easily be read in the tender and
unabashed expression of his handsome brown
eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Allerton, &ldquo;I come to the most
important part of my story. When Chaka learned
of the sore straights of my dear mother and sisters,
and found how unhappy the lack of wealth was
making us all, he became brooding and thoughtful,
and finally proposed to me a plan which, if
successful, would enable me to redeem the old
homestead, provide my family with every comfort,
and give me ample means besides. It is a bold&mdash;even
an audacious&mdash;conception; but it may be accomplished,
nevertheless, with Chaka&rsquo;s aid. I have
decided to undertake it, and have been preparing
for the expedition for more than a year. The last
thing necessary was my leave of absence, and this
you brought to me at Magdalena with the admiral&rsquo;s
despatches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You may guess that by this time Archie, Joe
and I were wide-eyed and open-mouthed with interest
in this remarkable story. We could hardly
wait for the lieutenant to explain his references to
the adventure on which he had embarked, and he
seemed to appreciate this and did not keep us
waiting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Maya tribes, which had inhabited Yucatan
for centuries before the Spaniards discovered
the country,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;were not, after all, the
original inhabitants of the promontory. Ancient
ruins of the cities and temples of the Mayas, equaling
in beauty and size any of those erected by the
Aztecs of Mexico, may yet be seen scattered over
the land. Their civilization, customs, laws and
literature amazed the early Spaniards who found
them. Yet long before the Mayas came a civilization
had existed in Yucatan greater than any they
could ever boast. The legends of Chaka&rsquo;s people,
the unconquered Itzaex, relate how the country
was first settled by a race from Atlantis, a great
island continent which was later submerged and
utterly destroyed by some unusual convulsion of
nature.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;This nation from Atlantis bore the name of
Tcha. It settled in the mountainous regions of
Yucatan, covering originally all that territory now
occupied by the Itzaex, the Mopanes and the Kupules,
midway between Campeache and the Mosquito
Coast. There they built great cities of white
marble, exquisitely carved, many of the walls bearing
hieroglyphics and picture writings not unlike
those of the ancient Egyptians. They were
learned in arts and sciences and had their libraries
and colleges. They worshipped the Sun-God&mdash;the
original deity of the Atlanteans&mdash;and also Bac&aacute;b,
a god afterward adopted by the Mayas, who
supported the heavens on his shoulders. The
rulers of the Tcha were all chosen from the priesthood,
the highest caste among them, and were
male or female, as the case might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chaka tells me that when the Mayas came to
Yucatan they found all these cities deserted and
falling to ruins. Only skeletons, lying here and
there in the streets, and found in great numbers in
the dwellings, showed that the palatial buildings
had ever known inhabitants. There is a great
mystery concerning these deserted cities. Some
think a pestilence fell upon the people and destroyed
them; others that a rain of scorpions depopulated
the country. Nothing remained, seemingly,
to tell the fate of this mighty vanished race.
The Mayas, being superstitious, were afraid to
occupy the marble cities. They tore down the
walls and used the materials for their own inferior
buildings. Scarce a vestige now remains of the
ancient civilization of the Tcha. Yet, according
to Chaka, a remnant of that wonderful people still
exists, in much the same way that it did six thousand
years ago; and strange as it may seem, inhabits
a hidden city in the mountains of Yucatan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>I had been getting a little weary of the historical
lecture; but now I saw why Allerton had related
it. A tribe of Atlanteans six thousand years
old, and living in a hidden city of Yucatan! Yes;
we were all intent enough by this time. It seemed
like a fairy romance, yet the words were uttered
with careful deliberation. I glanced at Chaka;
the grave look upon the Maya&rsquo;s face was ample
confirmation that he at least believed in the truth
of this marvelous statement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;This remnant of the Tcha was never discovered
by the Spaniards,&rdquo; continued Mr. Allerton,
&ldquo;and even the many tribes of the Mayas remain
to-day ignorant of their presence in Yucatan. It
is certain the owners of the various haciendas dotting
the plains at the west and north have never
heard of the hidden city. But the hereditary Atkayma
of the Itzaex has had the knowledge for
centuries, and kept the secret even from his own
people. In return for this protection the Tcha
have given to the rulers of the Itzaex certain powers
which have enabled them to resist all attacks
upon their domain and to remain free and unconquered
to this day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are not many of the ancient race of
Tcha, and they live so secluded in their mountain
fastness that nothing definite is known concerning
them. When Chaka&rsquo;s father was a young man
he, with a band of followers, unconsciously invaded
the territory of the Tcha and climbed the
mountain near their sacred retreat. The atkayma
and his men were promptly seized and carried into
the hidden city, where all were destroyed except
the Itzaex ruler. He was, after taking a solemn
oath, allowed to return to his people, so that by
means of his authority he might prevent any further
intrusion on the part of his subjects.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;When Chaka was old enough to understand
these things his father, the old atkayma, confided
to him this story, at the same time urging him,
when he in turn became the ruler of his nation,
to protect the Tcha from discovery or molestation.
One thing that Chaka especially remembers is his
father&rsquo;s description of the enormous wealth of the
hidden city, where the streets were literally lined
with gold and all ornaments and utensils were of
the same precious metal. Brilliant red jewels,
probably rubies, seemed as common as pebbles
elsewhere. The Itzaex are a simple people, caring
little for gold or gems, so the treasure of the Tcha
has never tempted them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, gentlemen, I think you will understand
from this brief relation the adventure upon
which Chaka and I have embarked. My friend
will guide me to his people, the Itzaex, and from
there we will make a descent on the hidden city of
the ancient Tcha and collect such treasure as we
are able.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I drew a long breath, while Archie, Joe and I
stared into one another&rsquo;s eyes. How curious it
seemed that just at this juncture, when we had
supposed we were through with fortune hunting
for good and all, this alluring tale was suddenly
told us. We were eager to know what would follow,
for it was evident that Allerton would not
have told us so much had he not, as indeed he had
hinted, desired our assistance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Uncle Naboth grunted as he shifted uneasily
on his deck chair. Uncle is a brave old fellow, and
adventurous, too; but he is getting old, and has
enough means to render him rather indifferent to
treasure seeking.</p>
<p>My father seldom allows his feelings to be detected
from his expression. He has a way of wiggling
that wooden leg of his from side to side that
often tells me his mood; but he is accustomed to
restrain all speech until he has fully made up his
mind, after which it is very difficult to move him.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I thought, the leg did not now indicate
that he was much disturbed. He actually
seemed interested in the lieutenant&rsquo;s recital and
was at present slowly revolving it in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose, sir,&rdquo; began Uncle Naboth, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d
like us to drop you on the coast, near to where
you&rsquo;ll find Chaka&rsquo;s people. We&rsquo;ll do that. But
as fer waitin&rsquo; to pick you up, when you&rsquo;re ready
to quit, why that&rsquo;s a hard thing to figger on, seein&rsquo;
no one knows how long the job&rsquo;ll take you, or if
you&rsquo;ll ever get away at all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Mr. Allerton did not reply at once. When he
did his voice trembled a little, as if the matter he
was about to broach were of vital importance to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to make you a proposition, gentlemen,&rdquo;
he said, addressing us all, &ldquo;and I hope you will consider
it carefully before rejecting it. There is untold
wealth in the secluded city of the Tcha. If we
are going there to plunder we may as well take
enough to make every one of us rich. Yet my idea
is not to rob that ancient people, but to obtain a
portion of their gold and jewels by fair means.
They have an ancient superstition that if a white
man ever discovers their retreat he will become
their master&mdash;second only in power to the Sun-God.
Even the priests must bow before him and
admit his supremacy. They believe that such a
white man, capable of penetrating to their city,
would be a superior being, excelling themselves in
intelligence; for their city is carefully guarded
from all possible intrusion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;This story may or may not be true; yet, without
knowing anything very definite about the city
or the people we are to visit, both Chaka and I consider
it reasonable to suppose that this isolated
race, cut off from all the rest of the world and its
progress, and despising gold and jewels except for
their beauty, might be delighted with some of the
convenient and pretty knickknacks and modern inventions
so common to us, and so inexpensive. So
I have packed in my chests a supply of novelties
which I will offer to trade for gold and rubies,
thus obtaining the desired treasure in a legitimate
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds reasonable, an&rsquo; clever, too,&rdquo; remarked
my father, nodding approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve quite a lot of beads and cheap jewelry
aboard myself,&rdquo; announced Archie. &ldquo;Perhaps we
could trade that in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t imagine people who have rubies and
gold would care for cheap jewelry,&rdquo; replied Joe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;My original idea,&rdquo; said Allerton, &ldquo;was to go
alone with Chaka to his people, and have them
escort us to the neighborhood of the hidden city.
There Chaka and I would make an attempt to
evade the guards and slip into the city, using some
appliances to accomplish this which I will explain
to you later. But the more I have dwelt upon this
adventure, the more dangerous it seems to me if
undertaken by two people. The truth is that I
have made somewhat elaborate preparations to
impress this unknown nation, and I need more
assistance than Chaka can render, and more intelligent
comrades than the fierce native Itzaex.
The chances of success would be much greater, I
am sure, if I had half a dozen white comrades,
brave and trustworthy, willing to follow me anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one, Lieutenant!&rdquo; I cried, starting up
and extending to him my hand. &ldquo;Will you accept
me as a volunteer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Joe, calmly, &ldquo;if Sam goes of
course Archie and I go with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; nodded Archie, lazily.</p>
<p>Allerton seemed very grateful as he shook
our hands. We shook hands with Chaka, too, who
appeared to be equally pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knowed it!&rdquo; growled Uncle Naboth, ruefully;
&ldquo;I saw it comin&rsquo; from the start. Seems like we
can&rsquo;t sail in any direction without these fool boys
runnin&rsquo; their necks inter danger. That hidden city
sounds interestin&rsquo;, though. Guess I&rsquo;ll go, too,
Lieutenant&mdash;blamed if I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Now, my dear Uncle Naboth is so short and so
fat that his person is almost a ball in shape. Also
he wheezes a bit because his breath is scant, and
no one would be likely to select him for an ideal
mountain climber and adventurer, under any circumstances.
There was an amused gleam in
Allerton&rsquo;s eye as he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much, sir. I shall be delighted
to have you with us, if you can stand the
mosquitoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? Are they &rsquo;skeeters there?&rdquo; inquired my
uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great many, I fear. It is near the famous
Mosquito Coast, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Naboth looked grave and a bit uncomfortable,
but made no further remark. I knew
very well, however, that nothing on earth would
induce him to enter a jungle swarming with his
deadly enemies the mosquitoes, and that he would
find an early excuse to back out of the expedition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; course,&rdquo; said Captain Steele, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hev to
look after the <i>Seagull</i>, fer my part, an&rsquo; be ready to
pick you up when you&rsquo;ve made good. Hick&rsquo;ry legs
ain&rsquo;t much as mountain climbers, no how; so it&rsquo;s
just as well I ain&rsquo;t along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll take me with you, sir,&rdquo; said Ned
Britton, who had been silent until now, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll consider
it a rare favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allerton was genuinely glad of this splendid
recruit. Ned wasn&rsquo;t strong at brain-work, but of
powerful physique, active and fearless. I could
see that Chaka regarded him as the most valuable
of the volunteers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your half dozen whites, sir, including
yourself,&rdquo; said father. &ldquo;But I guess you&rsquo;d better
pick one more, &rsquo;cause Naboth&rsquo;ll be et up by
&rsquo;skeeters afore you get very far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must choose from among the sailors,&rdquo;
I suggested. &ldquo;They are all good men, Lieutenant,
and you can&rsquo;t go wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look them over awhile and make the selection
when I know them better,&rdquo; was Allerton&rsquo;s
reply. &ldquo;I cannot tell you how greatly your
prompt and hearty co&ouml;peration has delighted me.
These three young fellows,&rdquo; pointing to us in
turn, &ldquo;have won considerable renown already for
their desperate adventures, and not a man sails
the seas who hasn&rsquo;t heard of them and admired
their grit. I&rsquo;m in luck to have met you; in
greater luck to have you join my enterprise. And
now let us understand the terms of the agreement.
If we succeed&mdash;any of us&mdash;in returning to this
ship with treasure, I ask that a share be set aside
to reclaim my old homestead and support my
mother and sisters. If I should not be fortunate
enough to come out of the adventure alive, then I
ask you to keep Chaka with you and make him
your friend, sending on my share of the spoils to
my family. You can easily obtain Chaka&rsquo;s discharge
from the navy, as he has served the required
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, sir,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;We are all
taking chances, as we know very well, and I think
the best way to fix the business deal is to say that
your home shall be redeemed first of all, as that is
the main object of the undertaking. After that
all of us who come back safe and sound may share
and share alike. What do you say, Uncle
Naboth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me that&rsquo;s fair and square,&rdquo; added
Archie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re furnishing the ship an&rsquo; crew,&rdquo; remarked
my father, musingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, sir,&rdquo; responded Allerton readily. &ldquo;But
in those seven chests I have an outfit fully as important
for the success of the expedition as your
ship and crew. We will let one offset the other,
if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me,&rdquo; declared my father, who cared less
for driving a bargain than for asserting the importance
of the <i>Seagull</i>. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; pretty
late, boys, and I&rsquo;m sleepy. Guess my wooden
leg&rsquo;s fell asleep a&rsquo;ready. So let&rsquo;s turn in and
do the rest o&rsquo; the talkin&rsquo; later on. There&rsquo;ll be lots
o&rsquo; time to figger everything out afore we round
the Horn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we separated, the group on deck breaking
up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE SCENT DANGER AHEAD</span></h2>
<p>We were all somewhat thoughtful after this
interview, for it was evident we had undertaken
an adventure the details of which were quite
obscure to us. For my part I was too nervous
and excited to bunk in just yet, so I took Joe&rsquo;s
arm and we walked over to the bow, where the
clear starlight enabled us to watch the <i>Seagull</i> cut
her way through the water. Chaka was at the
rail before us, and started to move away; but I
stopped him, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all brothers now, Chaka, and therefore
we must become better friends. Now that
we are aware of your station and rank in your
own country we stand equal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that?&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;Is the Atkayma of
the Itzaex merely the equal of a common seaman?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not common, Joe,&rdquo; I protested; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve
a notion a decent American is the social equal of
an Indian chief. It&rsquo;s social equality I&rsquo;m talking
about, not rank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Sam is right,&rdquo; observed Chaka, with
a smile that would have fascinated a woman.
&ldquo;Equality among men is found only in heart and
brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His readiness to converse, remembering his former
reserve, almost startled me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; drawled Joe. &ldquo;But
tell us, Chaka, is there much danger in this coming
adventure, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Maya looked grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty danger, Cap&rsquo;n Joe.&rdquo; Every one was a
&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n&rdquo; to Chaka; he considered it a complimentary
title, bound to please. &ldquo;Danger from Itzaex,
first of all; but not much, for I am Chief&rsquo;s son.
More danger from Mopane tribe, who hate Itzaex.
Most danger from the mighty Tcha, who very
strong, very jealous, very watchful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are those people like?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>The Maya shook his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;My father not tell me. When I ask, he tremble,
like he afraid; and my father is brave man.
But the Tcha country very small&mdash;in the middle
of a mountain&mdash;and their legend say a white
man some day discover them and be their master.
My brother Paul is white man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think our greatest danger will be to
get to the hidden city, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It long, bad journey. Mopanes watch
by seashore, and fight us. My own people I have
not seen for many years. When I find them they
greet me as child of the sun, and help me. But
Itzaex hate all white men, and I must use my
power to protect white men from their hatred.
That will be a danger to you, if not to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Well, it promises to be an exciting trip,
all right,&rdquo; I said cheerfully, for the truth was that
the danger of the adventure appealed to me more
than the prospect of securing treasure. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
always necessary to fight your way in a hostile
country, in order to win out, Chaka. Diplomacy
and caution, backed by a little good judgment, are
better than guns and pistols. Eh, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little courage in avoiding a fight has often
done us good service, Sam,&rdquo; agreed my friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Chaka seemed to approve this view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometime my brother Paul tell you more,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>I noticed he now spoke of Allerton as &ldquo;my
brother Paul,&rdquo; when mentioning him to us; and
there was a world of affection in the way he said
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Paul has a big brain; his mind see far
ahead. Also he have great man for Uncle&mdash;Cap&rsquo;n
Simeon Wells. We spend whole month
last summer with Cap&rsquo;n Wells, who know how to
do many strange things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a jim-cracker electrician, all right,&rdquo; said
Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He give much wonder-things to my brother
Paul, to help him with the Mopanes, the Itzaex
and the Tcha. We keep wonder-things in the
seven big boxes. You see, some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this information the Maya left us, and
Joe and I sat another hour discussing the coming
adventure before we finally turned in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Uncle Naboth was pretty glum next morning.
He was trying to find some way to back out of the
expedition gracefully and with credit. Finally he
said to us:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys ain&rsquo;t to be depended on; I&rsquo;ve found
that out. We had all our plans fixed to get into
a steady, respectable coast trade, where there
wouldn&rsquo;t be a single thing to keep any o&rsquo; us awake
nights; and here, when we&rsquo;re only a week out o&rsquo;
port, you&rsquo;ve gone an&rsquo; upsot the whole deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> funny, Uncle, I&rsquo;ll admit,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;But
you can&rsquo;t blame us for it, I&rsquo;m sure. Lay it to
Fate, where the responsibility belongs. Remember,
too, that you were one of the first to offer to
join the expedition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I were wrong about that, Sam,&rdquo; he replied,
eagerly. &ldquo;I meant to stick to my principles, as
an honest man should. An&rsquo;, by jinks, I <i>will</i> stick
to my principles! Don&rsquo;t try to argy with me;
don&rsquo;t try to coax me. As sure as my name&rsquo;s
Naboth Perkins I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to stick to this ship,
whatever you reckless bunch o&rsquo; youngsters may
decide on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you back down, sir?&rdquo; demanded Archie,
who was secretly much amused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; not a jot. I stick to my first principles;
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, we were glad he took it that way, for we
didn&rsquo;t want Uncle Naboth with us. He was
brave enough, we knew; but he had a way of getting
us all into unnecessary trouble, and his rotund
figure prevented him from being as active
as the rest of us. A better fellow never lived than
this same Naboth Perkins, but we all felt he was
safer on board ship than in the wildernesses of
Yucatan, and we had a suspicion we would be
safer without him, too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>From that time on the adventure was our one
topic of conversation. Chaka suggested that he
teach us to speak the Maya tongue during the
voyage, and we eagerly accepted the offer. I had
already a smattering of Arabian and Chinese and
could speak fluently the native language of our
South Sea Islanders, Nux and Bryonia. So it
was little trouble to me, with the painstaking instructions
of Chaka and Allerton, to learn to comprehend
fairly the Maya tongue. Joe was a natural
linguist and kept pace with me easily, but
poor Archie was woefully thick-headed when it
came to foreign languages. Even Ned Britton,
who was wholly uneducated, got along better than
he. We kept up our lessons until the day we
sighted the coast of Yucatan, but even then
Archie understood only a few words of Maya.
The mate, for his part, knew all that was said to
him, but was rather slow and uncertain of speech,
while Joe and I could converse readily with Allerton
and Chaka in the Maya.</p>
<p>One of the queerest things, in this regard, was
our discovery that black Nux, our steward, had
caught on to Chaka&rsquo;s language with little difficulty,
and had himself taught it to Bry. They
surprised us one evening by joining in our conversation,
and that decided Allerton to ask permission
to add them to our party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never seen finer physical specimens of
manhood than these blacks,&rdquo; he said to me, &ldquo;and
your reports of their loyalty and courage have
quite warmed my heart toward them. Perhaps
their jet black complexions would be as great a
novelty to the Tcha as white skins, and these
fellows will add greatly to the strength of our
party.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;That will make nine of us, altogether&mdash;,&rdquo; I
said musingly; &ldquo;you and Chaka, we three boys,
Ned Britton, a sailor, and Nux and Bryonia. By
the way, have you chosen the sailor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I shall take the Mexican who is called
Pedro,&rdquo; answered Allerton. &ldquo;He is an active fellow
and looks honest. Moreover, he is accustomed
to a climate similar to that of Yucatan,
which is at present a province of Mexico, although
so much of it is yet an unexplored wilderness. Do
you think Pedro will be willing to join us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, if only for a share of the spoils,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;But I advise you not to mention the subject
to him until the last moment. You see, every
man jack of them forward would like to go too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As you may imagine, we asked many questions
of Chaka during the voyage regarding his native
country, and the route we were to take to get
there. On the whole his answers were clear and
satisfactory, for although he had been away for
nine years he was a youth of fifteen when forced
to escape the Mopanes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>According to his statements all the tribes of
Yucatan Indians are called Mayas, and have a
common language which varies only slightly according
to the dialects of the scattered tribes.
All the natives, with the exception of the Itzaex,
have at times been conquered by the Spaniards,
who first invaded the peninsula in 1506. But the
Mayas are mostly wild and untamed to this day,
and save for the tribes inhabiting the flat and settled
portions of the North and West they indulge
in the same barbaric and warlike existence as
when the whites first came among them.</p>
<p>After four hundred years of settlement there is
less land tilled in Yucatan to-day than there was
in its first century of annexation to Spain. The
interior and mountainous district is still a wilderness
and exceedingly dangerous for a white man
to enter.</p>
<p>The most powerful and warlike tribe, now as in
the beginning, is that of the Itzaex. These people
have no desire to acquire more territory, but hold
firmly to their original heritage and fight desperately
any of their neighbors who dare cross
their boundaries. On the other hand, the Itzaex
are barred from the seashore by a fierce tribe
known as the Mopanes, and on other sides by the
Kupules and Choles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>The hidden city of the remnant of the ancient
Tcha nation lies directly in the heart of the Itzaex
territory, which is doubtless the reason none of
the other tribes is aware of its existence. The
chief city of Itzlan is built on the shores of a
beautiful fresh water lake lying two thousand feet
above the sea level; but Chaka declares no mortal
eyes save those of his own tribe have ever yet beheld
the place. Which, of course, makes us the
more eager to see it.</p>
<p>We had a most delightful voyage south, the
Pacific being on its good behavior. Excellent
time was made even through the turbulent waters
of the Horn, and not until we had rounded the
continent and were in the waters of the Atlantic
did Allerton again refer to the contents of his
seven mysterious chests.</p>
<p>One day, however, he proposed opening them,
as he said it would be well for all of us who were
to join the expedition to be thoroughly familiar
with their contents. So, one by one, the boxes
were brought into the roomy main cabin by Nux
and Bryonia, where Allerton proceeded to open
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE INSPECT A NOVEL AERIAL INVENTION</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You must understand,&rdquo; said the lieutenant,
&ldquo;that from the moment I decided to undertake
this adventure I began preparing my &lsquo;sinews of
war&rsquo;. I calculated that an isolated people like the
Tcha would be greatly impressed by our wonderful
modern inventions. Also I figured that many
things might be collected by me which would assist
in the difficult task of penetrating a hostile
territory and climbing the almost inaccessible
mountains leading to the hidden city. Fortunately
I was stationed last summer for more than a
month at Washington, where I confided my plans
to my uncle, Simeon Wells, and had many long
conversations with him as to a proper equipment
for this difficult undertaking. His cleverness
in electrical matters was of great assistance
to me, for his famous storage battery, combining
tremendous power with light weight, will enable
me to carry some important devices into the very
heart of the wilderness. Also my uncle knew of
several recent inventions of which I was myself
ignorant, and through his influence I managed
to secure them. Here, for instance, is an important
example.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>With this he took from a chest a curious contrivance
that seemed to us like a cross between a
rubber air-cushion and an undershirt. As Allerton
explained the thing, it was to be worn by pulling
it on over the head and allowing it to loosely
cover the body from the neck down to the thighs.
It was composed of two layers of thin, ribbon-like
tissue, and could be inflated like a balloon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This strap,&rdquo; explained Allerton, &ldquo;is for attaching
to your left side a small metal case&mdash;here
is one&mdash;containing the crystals of themlyne. By
pouring a little water upon the crystals, through
the valve, a very volatile but powerful gas is created,
called &lsquo;theml,&rsquo; which inflates the garment.
Chaka will put one on, so you may see exactly
how it works.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>The Maya immediately complied, slipping the
rubber arrangement over his head and putting
his arms through the holes provided for that purpose.
He then attached the metal case, which I
think was aluminum, and supplied the themlyne
crystals with water. At once the gas began rushing
into the queer garment, which became inflated
until Chaka&rsquo;s upper half was puffed out in a ludicrous
manner. He turned off the gas, then, and
cast an inquiring glance at Allerton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of weighing some one hundred and
eighty pounds, as he did a while ago,&rdquo; announced
the lieutenant, &ldquo;Chaka is now but little heavier
than air itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To verify this the Maya leaped lightly to the
cabin table, bounding back to the floor again with
the resilience of a rubber ball.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;In climbing mountains,&rdquo; explained Allerton,
&ldquo;as well as in descending precipices and the like,
this inflated garment will prove invaluable. It is
not made of rubber, as perhaps you imagine, but
of a new and wonderful material as tough as steel,
and as impenetrable. It is a recent scientific discovery
to be used in making unpuncturable automobile
tires, and I am the first person who has
ever adapted it to any other purpose. The gas-jacket,
as I call it, was suggested by Uncle Simeon,
and I immediately appreciated its value.
There are ten of them in this chest, each fitted
with a themlyne tank for inflating it. Now I will
demonstrate its most important use. If Chaka
lets a little more gas into the jacket it will carry
him off his feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chaka did this, slowly rising like a balloon to
the ceiling of the cabin, but remaining upright because
his legs anchored him in a perpendicular position.
He now touched a valve which released
a certain portion of the gas and enabled him to
descend again to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the jacket is ordinarily worn,&rdquo; said Allerton,
&ldquo;the idea is to retain enough weight in your
body to enable you to control all your motions, at
the same time reducing your weight to the extent
of preventing fatigue. I could leap over a precipice
in that jacket and alight at the bottom uninjured.
If I wished to escape an enemy, I could
soar into the air, out of reach.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>He took out his pocket knife and asked me to
slash or prick the gas-jacket which Chaka was
wearing; but the material resisted all my attempts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt,&rdquo; remarked Allerton, &ldquo;if a bullet at
close range would penetrate it; I have never tried
the experiment, but where we are going there are
no bullets used by the natives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were all filled with wonder at this curious
contrivance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much gas will that little case of crystals
generate?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough to inflate the jacket a half dozen
times,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But I have an ample supply
of themlyne crystals in another chest, to replenish
the cases when necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t any other gas do?&rdquo; inquired Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so well. And no other gas can be procured
so quickly and easily as themlyne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, when the stuff is gone the jackets
are useless,&rdquo; suggested Joe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but we do not expect to use much gas except
in case of emergency. At such times we are
sure to find the jackets very useful. There is an
appliance I myself have invented to attach to the
fully inflated garments, which will render them
equal to aeroplanes, and much more reliable and
safe,&rdquo; continued Allerton.</p>
<p>He motioned to Chaka, who took from the
chest two objects that resembled closed Japanese
fans, which the native first buckled to either side
of his gas-jacket and then thrust his arms through
a series of catgut loops. Allerton had to assist
him in this, as the bulky jacket kept Chaka from
using his hands to good advantage. When all
was ready, the Maya raised his arms and showed
himself possessed of wings. As his arms hung
down by his sides the wings remained closed; as
he raised them the fans unfolded. They were
made of a material similar to that of the jacket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have not had much opportunity to experiment
with these wings,&rdquo; admitted the lieutenant.
&ldquo;They may prove awkward, at first, and perhaps
unaided would not carry one far into the air. But
when one has ascended to an altitude by means of
the inflated jacket the wings should enable him to
direct his course, and to soar with the wind, or
tack as a ship does, for long distances.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see much practical use in all these fixin&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
remarked Uncle Naboth. &ldquo;Seems to me you
ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to Yucatan to do circus acts or to knock
out the Wright brother, but jest to fight a lot o&rsquo;
Injuns an&rsquo; grab some gold an&rsquo; things. Could you
carry much of a load through the air in them
jackets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear not,&rdquo; admitted Allerton, gravely. &ldquo;As I
before stated, one of my ideas is to impress the
natives with the wonders of our modern civilization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it orter do that, all right. It&rsquo;s impressed
me,&rdquo; said Uncle Naboth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE SEE AN ASTONISHING THING</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;The most wonderful thing I have to show
you,&rdquo; said Lieutenant Allerton, as Chaka divested
himself of the gas-jacket and, after folding and
putting it away, prepared to open another chest,
&ldquo;is that which I owe entirely to the genius of my
inventive uncle, and his friendly interest in me.
Indeed, I may say with truth that you are the first
persons in all the world, save the President of the
United States, my uncle and myself and Chaka,
who have ever been initiated into the mysteries of
the marvelous electrite. That is not its correct
scientific name, but that is what I shall call it.
Some day I am sure this invention will revolutionize
and abolish warfare, securing peace to all
the nations of the earth. It is so tremendous in
its possibilities that when Uncle Simeon finally
perfected it, after years of experimenting, he was
afraid to give it to the public. He took the President
into his confidence, with the result that they
have decided to wait and watch conditions before
deciding what to do with the electrite. But my
uncle has been anxious to test the contrivance in
actual use, and at my earnest entreaty permitted
me to have eight of them made, to carry with me
on my expedition. I may say that I rely more
upon the possession of these electrites than upon
any other portion of my equipment to carry us
through to success.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>In the chest which Chaka now opened we saw
a number of carefully wrapped parcels. One of
these the lieutenant picked up and opened on the
cabin table. There was a layer of stout paper, a
wooden box, a covering of felt, one of chamois,
then white tissue&mdash;and finally Allerton produced
a nickel plated tube fifteen inches long and curved
at one end like the handle of a revolver. From
this handle dangled two insulated electric wires.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>We were much interested in this proceeding,
but as yet unable to understand what the tube was
for. From a square box Allerton next withdrew
a belt that at first glance resembled a cartridge-belt,
except that it was broader and twice as thick.
All around the outer surface was a row of curious
electric tubes, joined irregularly together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the exhibitor, proceeding to strap
the belt around his waist, &ldquo;is the most condensed
form of the famous Simeon Wells storage battery.&rdquo;
He then attached the wires of the tube
to the belt and slipped the electrite into a loop, or
holster, at his right side. &ldquo;I am now ready,&rdquo;
continued Allerton, &ldquo;to meet any savage beast or
any foe that dares face me, for I am armed with
the most powerful weapon the world of science
has ever produced. If attacked I draw the electrite,&rdquo;
suiting the action to the word, &ldquo;point it at
my enemy, and press this button on the tube with
my thumb. That will release a charge of electricity
sufficient to stun an elephant at a hundred yards&rsquo;
distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We looked at him in wonder, and many exclamations,
varied according to the temperament
of the members of our group, greeted his
assertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many times will it shoot?&rdquo; asked Archie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-five times. That will exhaust the
power of the belt,&rdquo; replied Allerton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; said Captain Steele.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must use another belt, sir. I have
six belts for each electrite, and eight electrites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever tested it?&rdquo; I asked, a little bewildered
as I began to comprehend the marvel of
the thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; not yet. But Professor Wells, the inventor,
has fully tested its power, first on dogs and
small animals, then on a horse, and finally upon
his janitor, who agreed to submit to the ordeal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say he murdered the man!&rdquo;
cried Uncle Naboth, horrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, sir. The most astonishing thing
about the electrite is that it doesn&rsquo;t kill&mdash;it stuns.
A charge from it will knock a man over instantly,
rendering him unconscious and apparently lifeless.
From two to three hours later, depending upon
his physical condition and vitality, he will regain
consciousness and be little the worse for his experience
save perhaps for a headache. This is
why I told you the electrite is destined to abolish
war and conserve peace. Nothing can stand
against it. Its use will enable an army to conquer
and yet avoid bloodshed. If electrites were
used by two opposing forces no wails of widow
and orphans would follow in the wake of a battle
to cast their gloom over the victors.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>We sat spellbound and in silence for a time,
thoughtfully considering these things. Gradually
I, for my part, began to appreciate the marvel of
this great invention.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to test it,&rdquo; said Joe, calmly. &ldquo;Will
you try it on me, Lieutenant?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are too valuable a person to experiment
upon,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but in a way Chaka and I have
tested each of our eight tubes, using an extra
storage belt which I brought along for that purpose.
We secured permission to hunt, one day,
on the shore of Magdalena Bay, and knocked over
rabbits, gulls and a couple of coyotes with ease.
We could not wait to see if they recovered, but I
have Uncle Simeon&rsquo;s assurance that, in the case of
a man, recovery is certain unless he has some bad
heart trouble or other physical defect. Uncle&rsquo;s
janitor, upon whom he experimented&mdash;a brawny
Irishman&mdash;was upon his feet again in a little more
than two hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s surely a queer weapon,&rdquo; remarked Uncle
Naboth. &ldquo;But when it comes to fighting natives
in Yucatan I guess I&rsquo;d prefer a good rifle. What&rsquo;s
the use of knockin&rsquo; an enemy over if you don&rsquo;t put
him out o&rsquo; business for good an&rsquo; all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one likes to kill a human being when it can
be avoided,&rdquo; I answered, rather indignantly. &ldquo;If
we are opposed by natives and can render them
unconscious for two hours, it&rsquo;s just as good for
our purpose as killing the poor devils.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;My idea, exactly, Sam,&rdquo; approved Allerton.
&ldquo;But unfortunately we cannot use our electrites
at will, being limited in our number of battery
charges. So we must carry guns and revolvers,
too, and save these finer weapons for emergencies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then proceeded to show us other curious
things contained in the chests, some of which you
will hear of during the progress of my story.
Three of the big boxes were completely filled with
mechanical toys and novelties, aluminum utensils,
brass buttons, metal combs, brushes of various
sorts, bales of gorgeous colored silks and china
ornaments. Allerton admitted that these things
had cost him considerable money, practically exhausting
the combined resources of his eccentric
but inspired uncle and himself, as well as Chaka&rsquo;s
savings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we do not succeed,&rdquo; said he, quietly enough,
&ldquo;I shall be a bankrupt. But if my plans carry, as
I hope they will, no sacrifice is too great to redeem
the old homestead and provide for the future of
those dear, dependent women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Succeed!&rdquo; cried Archie; &ldquo;of course we&rsquo;ll succeed.
With such an outfit as that there&rsquo;s no
chance at all of failure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>No one replied to this enthusiastic speech. We
were busy with our thoughts. There was a long
and difficult journey before us, fraught with desperate
adventures, before any one might say with
assurance that success lay within our grasp.</p>
<p>But we considered it worth the attempt,
nevertheless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE OUTWIT THE ENEMY</span></h2>
<p>In the gray of the morning I stood with my
friends beside the rail, peering anxiously at a dim
black line that marked the Yucatan coast. In
order to avoid the islands and settled coast districts
of the north-east we had approached Yucatan
by way of the Mosquito Coast and British
Honduras, expecting to sight the country in its
wildest and most barbarous district.</p>
<p>Chaka, who had resided as a boy in the interior
but had made several trips to the sea, was
uncertain whether he would recognize the Bay of
Mopa from the water or not. It was from the
bay I have mentioned, which lay in the hostile
Mopane territory, that the trail led into the country
of the Itzaex&mdash;the only trail Chaka knew of
and therefore the trail we must follow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Although waging a fierce warfare with neighboring
tribes the Mopanes were accustomed to
deal arbitrarily with ships and expeditions from
Honduras which came to trade for the enormous
green turtles that abounded on their coast. This
fact we relied upon to shield us from immediate
hostilities.</p>
<p>As the sun slowly rose and dissolved the gray
shades from the morning sky we found ourselves
quite near to a wild but very attractive shore.
The sandy beach was shelving and touched the
sea at a level. Back of the beach began the scrub&mdash;low
bushes somewhat resembling our sage-brush,
but set closer together. Beyond the scrub rose the
great forests of logwood and mahogany, covering
the land as far as the eye could reach.</p>
<p>Chaka told us the villages of the Mopanes were
all within the forest&rsquo;s edge, but by eight o&rsquo;clock,
when we came close enough to view the scene distinctly,
we were enabled to see statuesque bronze
figures dotting the shore here and there. Doubtless
these were sentinels, set to watch us and see
where we landed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here!&rdquo; exclaimed the Maya, shaking his
head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>We swung around and steamed slowly north,
keeping sharp watch for hidden shoals and rocks,
as no map in my father&rsquo;s collection was able to
guide a mariner in these practically unknown
waters. Small bays and indentations were numerous,
and each of these Chaka scanned with
thoughtful care. Once, indeed, he decided he had
found the right place, and we ventured into a
pretty bay and lay to while our guide carefully
considered the landmarks. But the native, although
slow to form conclusions, had a positive
nature and was not to be deceived by minor appearances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here, Cap&rsquo;n Steele,&rdquo; he said again, and
we stood out and continued on our way, hugging
the coast as closely as we dared in order to give
Chaka a better view.</p>
<p>We passed the whole day in this tedious search
and it was almost evening when the Maya gave a
cry of delight and raised his arms to indicate that
he had sighted the right haven. It was more a
bight than a bay, and my father looked grave at
the huge rocks scattered a full quarter of a mile
from the shore line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Natives watched us here, as everywhere, and
when we lay to a score of dugouts were pushed
into the water and filled with Indians who soon
swarmed along our side. Chaka now kept out of
their sight, fearing to be recognized, and Allerton
called to one lot of natives which showed an impudent
disposition to board us, to keep off or take
the consequences. They were astonished to hear
a white man speak the Maya tongue and declared
they wanted to come aboard to &ldquo;trade.&rdquo; Allerton
replied that we had nothing to trade and would
proceed at once on our way north.</p>
<p>This did not seem to satisfy them. They were
all copper-colored, athletic fellows, quick and
nervous in action and with jet-black eyes which
glinted fiercely. They seemed utterly unafraid of
us and one boat load of four made a sudden dash
up our side, leaping to seize a rope ladder we had
left swaying from the bulwarks and climbing it
with the agility of cats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Ned Britton happened to be watching that spot
and the burly mate grasped the first native by an
arm, swung him clear of the side, and then hurled
him bodily at the others following. All four went
down with a rush, disappearing below the surface
of the placid water, while their comrades screamed
an angry defiance and sent a volley of small slender
darts&mdash;which reminded me of arrows&mdash;aimed at
every head showing above the side. We had no
trouble in dodging them, but Allerton warned us
they were poisoned and we did not relish such an
attack.</p>
<p>Captain Steele had already rung to go ahead
and we gathered way and moved from our dangerous
position as quickly as possible. The natives
Ned had dislodged scrambled into their boat again,
but the fellow he had seized seemed to have a
broken arm and howled lustily as his comrades
dragged him aboard.</p>
<p>The Mopanes showed no disposition to follow
us and as we gained the open sea we observed them
paddling back to the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty reception, I must say!&rdquo; growled
Archie in disgust. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the sort of vermin
we&rsquo;re supposed to tackle, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine this is only a sample of their peculiarities,&rdquo;
mused Joe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mopanes bad Indians,&rdquo; admitted Chaka, who
had now come on deck again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose we must take them as we find
them,&rdquo; I rejoined, with a sigh. &ldquo;The trouble
seems to be that no one has taken pains to civilize
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s our plan now, sir?&rdquo; asked Ned, turning
to Allerton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stand out until darkness comes on, and
then return to the bay with all lights out and disembark
as silently as possible,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;We rely on the usual native custom of &lsquo;sleeping
nights and fighting days&rsquo; to shield us from observation.
We have now created the impression that
we have sailed away for good, and as ships are a
rarity in this latitude the Mopanes will all retire
to their villages back in the forest and go to bed.
That will give us a chance to land, make our preparation
and get a good start on the secret trail
leading to the Itzaex country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meantime, what&rsquo;s to become of the ship?&rdquo;
asked Ned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Steele and his men will stand on and
off the coast until our return. We have arranged
a series of signals so that he will know when we
approach, and come in to meet us. His task will
be a tedious one, for if all goes well it will take
us at least two or three weeks to make our journey
and accomplish our purpose. Still, we may be
driven back at once, and need succor any day,
especially if Chaka&rsquo;s people refuse to recognize
his authority and show us hostilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the adventure will become
hopeless, will it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allerton looked sober and did not reply. Chaka
was quite undisturbed by the suggestion of disloyalty
on the part of his tribesmen and said, &ldquo;If
we can fight Mopanes, we also can fight Itzaex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the chests!&rdquo; I exclaimed, suddenly remembering
the baggage. &ldquo;What is to become of
them? One contains our supplies, you know, and
I imagine all are quite necessary to us. Yet how
will nine people be able to lug seven heavy chests
through a forest trail, beset with dangers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our outfits,&rdquo; explained Allerton, &ldquo;are contained
in three of the chests, so when we have
emptied those of their contents they may be left
behind. The other four will be provided with gas-jackets
and wheels. One man is sufficient to propel
each one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>I admit I looked and felt puzzled at this statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; continued our leader, &ldquo;it is time
for us to begin our preparations, while there is a
scrap of daylight. We may also light our decks
for a time, but on nearing shore we shall be black
as night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crew of the <i>Seagull</i>, having been already
apprised of our adventure and scenting the prize
money promised them, were every one eager to
be of assistance. The chests were brought on deck
and three of them opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must now shed for a time all European
customs and clothing,&rdquo; announced Paul. &ldquo;From
this moment we assume the outfits I have provided
for the occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>While the sailors looked on curiously he asked
Archie to strip and dress for his part. The boy
quickly shed his apparel, even to his underclothes,
for Allerton gave him first of all a union-suit
&ldquo;mosquito proof&rdquo;, and&mdash;as we later found&mdash;fairly
proof against the poisoned darts of the natives.
Knickerbockers and gaiters of a curious woven
gauze material&mdash;pliable metal, in fact&mdash;came next,
and the gas-jacket covered all the rest of his body
save the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jacket is also an armor,&rdquo; observed Allerton;
&ldquo;and, while it must be worn all the time,
night and day, it need not be inflated until necessary
to acquire lightness. The gas tank generator
weighs but six ounces and will be worn with
the jacket, so it may be ready in any emergency.
It is the same with the eight electrites, which we
eight adventurers will keep constantly at our sides.
The extra belts must, of course, remain in one of
the chests until needed, as will the extra supply of
themlyne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then supplied Archie with a head-mask of
curious design. The top was like a pith helmet,
very light and the more comfortable because it did
not rest upon the head but upon a globe of woven
wire, in which the boy&rsquo;s entire head was encased.</p>
<p>This material, as transparent as a fine gauze
screen, was so strong that when Allerton tested it
by jumping on it with both feet it scarcely bent
at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is a protection from gnats and mosquitoes,
darts and arrows, and all other venomous things,&rdquo;
said Paul. &ldquo;I think we shall find them quite comfortable
when we get used to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being attached to a collar, with straps underneath
the arms, these masks remained stationary,
allowing the wearer to move his head in any direction,
although he could not lower his chin very
much. High leather shoes, lined with the same
material, and pliable gauze gauntlets for the hands
and arms, completed this remarkable attire. When
Archie had slung his gun over his shoulder and
stuck a brace of revolvers and a bowie into his belt,
he certainly looked as curious as any individual
that ever walked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>I am quite sure that this description of Allerton&rsquo;s
outfit will lead the reader to think it exceedingly
clumsy and unmanageable; and such, at first
was my own opinion. But subsequent use proved
the contrary. Walking around to test his &ldquo;rigging,&rdquo;
as he called it, Archie declared he was not
uncomfortable in the least. Everything was very
light in weight, and the gauze garments were
cooler than the clothing he had been accustomed to.
Yucatan is a hot country, but not insufferably so,
owing to the prevailing breeze that comes from
the sea in either direction. Allerton had realized
this in preparing his outfits.</p>
<p>While the rest of us, using Archie as an example,
proceeded to dress ourselves in a like manner,
Allerton and Chaka were busily engaged in
drawing especially prepared gas-jackets over the
four chests we were to take with us. These
coverings were then inflated with themlyne until
the heavy boxes became so light that I could lift
any one of them with one hand. No other gas
known to science possesses so great buoyancy; a
small volume of it overcame weight&mdash;i. e., the
attraction of gravitation&mdash;to a wonderful degree.
A single wire wheel with a broad, flat tire, was
now attached to the front end of each chest, and
two handles to the rear, converting the baggage
into quaint looking wheelbarrows.</p>
<p>This task completed, Paul looked at a heap of
material on the deck and said, as if the thought
had just occurred to him:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see I have an extra outfit.&rdquo; He turned to
look at the interested group of sailors. &ldquo;Will any
one of you lads venture to join us?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>With one accord they stepped forward and
touched their caps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my friends,&rdquo; said Allerton gratefully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take Pedro, I think. He&rsquo;s a native
of this part of the world and therefore especially
fit to stand the climate. Will you come, Pedro?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought his face showed a trace of embarrassment,
perhaps chagrin, at being chosen; but he
stepped up alertly enough and was assisted into
his toggery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; remarked the lieutenant, &ldquo;I
was able to procure but eight electrites, so Pedro
must depend wholly upon his firearms for protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pedro grinned and nodded at hearing this. He
was wholly ignorant of what an electrite might be.
But he could handle a gun all right, he said, and
a good keen knife was his pet weapon. With
these by his side he felt perfectly safe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Uncle Naboth laughed immoderately as we
lined up on the deck, while Speckles, the boatswain,
who was now to act as mate to Captain Steele,
threw a searchlight over the group. For it was
quite dark by this time and we were again headed
back toward the bay where we were to disembark.</p>
<p>Nux and Bryonia, our stalwart blacks, seemed
gigantic in their novel equipment. Ned was almost
as huge a figure, while the rest of us, including
Chaka, sized up to a fair and even imposing
average. Pedro laughed at us too, and at himself,
while the sailors were frankly amused at our appearance.
I was myself somewhat influenced by
the humor of the situation, for while I have undertaken
many adventures during my brief life I was
never so garbed before&mdash;nor was any other man,
for that matter. We were the original gas-jacketed,
electrite-armed, mosquito-and-dart-proof
adventurers of the world!</p>
<p>Allerton and Chaka were serious enough, however,
to warn us that our fun was somewhat ill-timed.
We were on the eve of a desperate and
important undertaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to blacken up, my lads,&rdquo; said father, who
never neglected a sharp lookout. So every light
aboard was quickly &ldquo;doused&rdquo; except the shielded
one of the binnacle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>The night seemed especially favorable, although
Paul said that starlight would be as good for us
as an overcast sky, provided the natives were at
home and asleep. If by chance they were prowling
around they would see us anyhow. But, for my
part, I concluded it was just as well the white
<i>Seagull</i> did not show too plainly from shore
against the deep blue water. Those Mopanes had
sharp eyes, and if they observed our approach
from the forest there would promptly be something
doing.</p>
<p>Well, we crept into the bay quietly enough, after
all, only one muffled engine doing duty, and approached
the south bend of the shore as closely as
we dared. The boats were already on the davits,
the oars wrapped with canvas to prevent their
creaking. Into one we loaded the wheelbarrow
chests and then our little band took places in the
others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>I did not fail to press my father&rsquo;s hand before
I left the deck. Our affection is fervent and
strong, thank God, and we understand one another
perfectly. I knew the grim old fellow gave me a
prayer in his heart and trusted a tender Providence
to send his boy back to him in safety; but
never a word of protest or caution did he utter.
It might unnerve me, and was not needed.</p>
<p>With scarcely a sound our keels ground on the
beach. It required but a few moments to land and
carry the chests to the shore, and then we shook
hands, one and all, with the seamen and knew we
had their best wishes for our success. They returned
to the ship at once, and we adventurers
quickly prepared to follow Chaka, who from this
moment assumed the lead. Nux and Bryonia each
trundled a chest, as did also Pedro and Ned. The
things were so light that if we came to a rough
place the men raised them bodily and carried them
across.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE FIGHT A GOOD FIGHT</span></h2>
<p>In five minutes we were threading the underbrush,
a difficult task because it grew so thickly;
but fortunately it was not of great extent and a
journey of fifteen minutes brought us to the edge
of the forest.</p>
<p>Chaka had marked his way by sighting a group
of three giant mahoganies whose spreading tops
formed a perfect triangle. He paused a moment
just in the center of this group, pushed aside a
bunch of tangled vines and with a grunt of satisfaction
led us into a broad, well defined trail.
This, we understood, was the route followed by
the Itzaex when they invaded the territory of the
Mopanes, in order to gather turtle, or to fish. Such
invasions had always been bitterly contested, but
Chaka&rsquo;s people were never deterred from an undertaking
by the prospects of a fight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>It seems strange that after nine years this Indian
boy should remember the place at all. Chaka was
but fifteen when picked up by Allerton, and he
certainly did not look his twenty-four years now.
Civilized life had not taught him to forget his
boyish adventures, and Allerton must have placed
implicit confidence in the Maya, since all our plans
and hopes were based upon his assertions and his
knowledge of the country.</p>
<p>Joe, Archie and I, who had often talked over
these things, could not yet decide how far the
lieutenant was justified in his unswerving trust.
We liked Chaka and believed in him; but might
he not be deceiving himself as well as us in many
important details&mdash;especially those regarding the
Tcha and the hidden city? It was all hearsay,
after all, the tale of the old atkayma, who might
easily have exaggerated his experiences.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>It was dark as Erebus in the forest. I can&rsquo;t
imagine how Chaka found his way so accurately.
But he seldom hesitated, leading us forward at a
steady gait and only pausing when the narrow
way obliged us to use our best inventive genius in
getting the chests between the trees. Once or
twice we had to make a detour through wild and
tangled underbrush and networks of vines, in order
to squeeze the chests into the trail again, and all
this delayed us considerably.</p>
<p>After three hours of dogged progress we stopped
to rest, and now Chaka flashed a dark lantern on
the scene, believing we were so far from the Mopane
villages that the light would not be seen.
That helped some, as you may imagine, and it
seemed to me, with my limited knowledge of such
things, that we had covered at least a dozen miles
of forest path when Allerton called a halt and
said we would sleep until daylight.</p>
<p>We dozed in our outfits, just as we were, not
venturing to remove any part of our armor for
fear of a surprise. Nor were we at all uncomfortable.
I remember that I dropped down upon the
leaves and moss just where I had stood,
thoroughly tired by the long march. There was
little fear of scorpions, serpents or other vermin,
since we were so well protected, and I for one
needed no lullaby to send me fast asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Chaka and Allerton kept watch by turns, on
this occasion, and I heard Paul rebuking &ldquo;my
brother Chaka&rdquo; for not calling him when he should
have done so.</p>
<p>I thought it must still be night when they
wakened me, and in truth I was not at all ready to
get up; but when I rose and rubbed my eyes I
could dimly discern the trunks of the trees all
about me, with small patches of gray sky showing
here and there through the tops; so I realized it
was time to tramp on again.</p>
<p>Allerton unlocked a chest and gave us each a
cup of hot coffee from thermos bottles, where it
had been placed aboard ship. We ate some biscuits,
too, and felt greatly refreshed.</p>
<p>All had proceeded so nicely thus far that my
original fears as to the dangerous nature of this
undertaking had become lulled. It was cool and
pleasant under the shade of the trees as we started
on again, and the song birds were in full chorus.</p>
<p>Suddenly Chaka, who led us, stopped short and
held up his hand. Instantly Paul was beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hunting party. Warriors. Many,&rdquo; returned
the Maya, his head bent forward, listening
intently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are they Itzaex, my brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mopanes!&rdquo; said Chaka.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it mean fight, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means fight, my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silently we had stood listening to this. Now
we prepared for action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use your firearms first,&rdquo; commanded Allerton;
&ldquo;and then, if necessary, the electrites. But remember
we must save every charge in the batteries
that we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We placed the four chests on end in a row,
forming a scanty bulwark, and took station behind
them. The party of Mopanes, evidently returning
to their villages from a hunting expedition, were
now heard noisily jabbering in the distance, the
sounds gradually drawing nearer. It seemed they
knew and used this trail as well as the Itzaex did,
although Chaka had called it a &ldquo;secret trail.&rdquo; How
many we were about to face we could not conjecture,
but none of us showed or felt much fear.
Indeed, I am inclined to think we one and all welcomed
the chance to prove the qualities of our
equipment. I was sorry to receive orders not to
fire the electrite, being curious to know how effective
these queer weapons would be; but I well knew
Allerton was right in husbanding our supply of
stored electricity. We might need every charge
badly before we had played the game to the end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>The trail wound irregularly here and there
through the dense forest, but for some seventy
yards ahead it came straight toward us, broader
and more open than in most places, which was all
to our disadvantage. This was offset by the fact
that the natives had no suspicion an enemy was in
their path. They were between the Itzaex and
their own people, and imagined they had nothing
to fear. Not even a scout had been sent ahead.
They rounded the curve in a dense mass, chattering
and laughing until they caught sight of us
standing motionless in the trail. Then their astonishment
was genuine enough.</p>
<p>I think, had they found us garbed in the same
manner as all white men who had visited their
coast had been, that there might have been chance
for a parley; but our appearance was so strange
that they did not hesitate a moment about attacking
us. The first of the band, which numbered
about a hundred warriors, had scarcely halted
when their wicked darts began to fly in our direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>These darts, the most dangerous weapons employed
by the Maya tribes, are slim strips of a
tough vine, cut and hardened in the sun until they
become nearly as hard as steel. One end is sharpened
and coated with a deadly vegetable poison;
the other has a flat piece of bark inserted in a
notch to give it &ldquo;wings.&rdquo; The darts are carried
in a bark sheath and are hurled with amazing
swiftness and accuracy. The Maya tribes also use
bows and arrows, as well as long spears with
heads of sharpened stone or iron. But these latter
weapons are most serviceable in hunting; in a fight
the Mayas depend largely upon the darts, a prick
from one of the points sending its poison coursing
through the veins of the victim, who expires in
agony in a few minutes.</p>
<p>It may be the distance was in our favor; anyway
the darts rattled against our armor harmlessly
enough. And we did not give the enemy
time to come nearer, just then. Taking careful
aim we returned a volley from our rifles which,
backed by the thick mass of howling Indians, did
terrible execution. Nearly a score fell where they
stood and the others took to instant flight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>I felt much elated by our success until I noticed
Chaka shaking his head as if greatly annoyed.
There was little opportunity to inquire the reason,
for in a surprisingly brief space of time a dart
struck full upon my headgear, and so sharp was
the slender point that it stuck in the meshes and
hung there. Another and another dart followed,
from this or that side and even from behind us.
The cunning Mopanes had leaped into the thicket
and surrounded us, from their concealment being
enabled to attack us with impunity. Arrows also
flew, striking us sharp blows. A spear knocked
Pedro clean off his feet, but failed to wound him,
as it struck against his impervious gas-jacket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get out of this!&rdquo; exclaimed Allerton.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a regular trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; cried Chaka.</p>
<p>We followed his lead. The blacks, Ned and
Pedro wheeled the chests while we others walked
beside them and took a shot at every head that
showed in the jungle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>It proved somewhat revolting to climb over the
dead and dying that cluttered the way just ahead.
One wounded Mopane struck at my leg with a
knife and tried to grab me; but I clubbed him over
the head with my rifle and he fell back and lay
still.</p>
<p>There seemed no escape for us, as the rascals
were able to follow through the brushwood almost
as fast as we covered the trail; but Chaka moved
rapidly on, increasing his pace until we were all
on a jog-trot, and at last we understood his reason.</p>
<p>The path opened abruptly into a vast clearing,
nearly a quarter of a mile in extent. It had been
created originally by a forest fire, as the charred
trunks of trees testified. Near the center was a
small pool of stagnant water.</p>
<p>We ran to the edge of this pool and, facing
around once more, prepared to defend ourselves.
If the natives remained in the forest their weapons
were comparatively harmless; if they cared to
&ldquo;rush&rdquo; our position we had decidedly the best of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>They were in no hurry to decide, it seemed.
After hurling a few darts and shooting a few
arrows they ceased activities for a full hour, during
which time we sat on the chests and got our
breath back so we could discuss the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far are we from Itzlan?&rdquo; inquired Allerton.</p>
<p>Chaka considered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About two hours&rsquo; journey, Brother Paul,&rdquo; he
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hours from the boundaries, I suppose,&rdquo;
said Paul. &ldquo;And how far from the City of Itza?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two days, my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was not very encouraging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Archie, &ldquo;a good plan
would be to send Chaka on to his people as a scout.
He could sneak through the enemy all right. And
then he could bring his people to our rescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Allerton, &ldquo;I cannot afford to risk
Chaka on such a mission. If we lose him, we lose
everything. I am quite sure the Mopanes cannot
seriously injure us. We simply must devote the
necessary time to fighting them off, and then continue
our journey.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE FIND OURSELVES OUTNUMBERED</span></h2>
<p>The space or clearing in which we had sought
refuge was covered thickly with bushes averaging
from two to three feet in height. They were green
with a thick-leaved foliage, and as I sat idly looking
at them it occurred to me they were very pretty
in such a place and relieved the dismal appearance
of the charred stumps. Presently I decided, as
the sun was now beating down upon our heads, to
crawl underneath the nearest clump of bushes and
seek coolness in their shade. This I proceeded to
do, dropping on hands and knees and creeping
beneath the leafy covering while my friends eyed
me curiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Next moment I experienced one of the greatest
surprises of my life. I was not quite concealed by
the network of bushes when my head bumped
suddenly against something hard, and lifting my
encased face with some difficulty I found a Mopane
Indian lying flat upon his belly, his eyes&mdash;not
a yard away&mdash;glaring viciously into mine. I
think he must have been fully as much astonished
as I was.</p>
<p>In such emergencies I have a bad habit of acting
first and considering afterward; so before I realized
what I was doing I had pulled a revolver and
sent a bullet into the fellow&rsquo;s skull. He gave a
yell that was startling and sprang full upon his
feet before he toppled over dead.</p>
<p>His cry was echoed from fifty throats. From
every part of the bush arose Mopanes who rushed
at us with one accord. Some of them had crawled
pretty near. As I sat up I faced one at arm&rsquo;s
length and let go another shot from the revolver
I held.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Meantime my comrades quickly recovered from
the momentary paralysis caused by the suddenness
of the assault and stood their ground bravely. I
was very proud of their coolness. Nux and
Bryonia, Ned, Archie and Joe were all splendid
fighters and even Mexican Pedro seemed void of
fear as he plugged shot after shot at his assailants.
Altogether, the affray was too hot for the Mopanes
and they soon scampered back to the woods for
shelter. As they went we picked off as many of
them as we could, for the more we rendered <i>hors
de combat</i> the better chance we had to escape.</p>
<p>They were not likely to repeat this attempt
again. Another long wait followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to lose so much ammunition on the
fools,&rdquo; grumbled Allerton. &ldquo;Be shy, my lads, of
wasting a single shot; our work has hardly begun
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This stealthy attack of the natives gave Chaka
an idea, however. After consulting with his
&ldquo;Brother Paul&rdquo; he hid behind the chests and deliberately
began divesting himself of all the trappings
he had until now worn. When I glanced at
him, presently, there sat our Maya on the ground,
arrayed only in his copper colored skin and a white
loin cloth. In the folds of the latter he concealed
a knife and a small revolver. Then, lying flat, he
wriggled himself into the bushes and was soon
lost to view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>I tried to follow his course, but so expert a
woodsman was Chaka that not a movement of a
leaf betrayed his whereabouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his object, Paul?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to explore the path at the other
side of the clearing, where he believes the trees
are so open that the Mopanes won&rsquo;t dare follow
us. If that is so we won&rsquo;t wait for the next move
the devils make, but break for the trail at once
and fight our way on to the Itzaex country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;anything is better than
this.&rdquo; And so we sat and waited patiently for our
spy to return.</p>
<p>Meantime, as it was getting near noon, we took
advantage of the lull in hostilities to eat our luncheon.
The food refreshed us very much, and
Archie, who has always some longing unsatisfied,
bewailed the fact that we had no ice on such a
sultry day. I knew that we had ice, but said
nothing of it. In Allerton&rsquo;s thermos chest reposed
a fine cake of the crystallized fluid which, with
other things, he was reserving for &ldquo;emergencies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Fully two hours had passed before we observed
Chaka&rsquo;s naked body come bounding through the
clearing without any attempt at concealment. Evidently
he was in a state of great excitement.
Skirting the edge of the pool he came directly toward
us, disregarding the arrows and darts that
rained upon him from the nearest edge of the
forest. Then, with a final bound he fell flat at
our feet, sobbing in a very ecstasy of grief and
despair.</p>
<p>We looked at one another wonderingly as Allerton
knelt down, took his friend&rsquo;s head in his lap
and stroked the dark hair as tenderly as a woman
might have done. He asked no questions until
Chaka&rsquo;s passionate sobbing was gradually subdued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor brother!&rdquo; he said in the Itzaex dialect.</p>
<p>Chaka seized his hands and pressed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my father, dear Paul!&rdquo; he said, miserably.
&ldquo;They have killed the atkayma&mdash;they have murdered
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has done this, my brother?&rdquo; inquired
Allerton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mopanes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>We others looked upon the scene silently, forbearing
comment. I realized, for my part, that
the old atkayma&rsquo;s death might seriously affect the
success of our enterprise; but I had not suspected
Chaka was so fond of his royal father, having left
him to his own devices for so many years.</p>
<p>As for that, however, I had not reckoned on the
horror of the thing, although I might have appreciated
better Chaka&rsquo;s sensitive nature, so astonishing
in one born to a savage life.</p>
<p>Before long the youth was able to tell his story,
and he told it none too soon, either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found the trail,&rdquo; said he, speaking his own
tongue, which we all understood save Pedro and
Archie&mdash;and perhaps the latter caught a few
words. &ldquo;I ran along it swiftly for some distance.
Then I heard shouts and the Mopane war song
of victory. I knew another band of those devils
was approaching us and hid myself to count their
numbers. They are many, oh my brother! There
has been war, and for this once my people have
been defeated. I know not where the battle was
fought nor how many were engaged; but victory
is with our enemies. On their spears they bear
the heads of many brave Itzaex; foremost among
them is that of the great, the noble atkayma&mdash;my
father!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>He broke down again, to renew his sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Chaka!&rdquo; said Paul.</p>
<p>There was no time left us for more parley. We
began to hear the shouts of the approaching hosts
and must prepare for a desperate defense. It was
all right for Chaka to grieve over his father; it
struck me as a curious coincidence that just as
the royal son arrived in his own country, after an
absence of many years, the aged atkayma of the
Itzaex met his fate at the hands of his persistent
enemies.</p>
<p>The Mopanes deployed into the clearing in a
dense throng, exultantly shouting their savage
paeans. Some blew shrill blasts on conch shells;
one or two battered energetically the native kettledrums,
made from tortoise shells over which skins
were tightly stretched.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>At once the new arrivals were joined by the
remnant of the band that had first attacked us. I
say &ldquo;remnant&rdquo; because we must have slain or
wounded nearly half of their original number.
With eager exclamations they pointed in our direction,
and the eyes of every warrior examined
us intently. They were standing some distance
away, but we could observe their every action
distinctly. One huge fellow, who bore a spear
with a grinning head set on its point, leaped upon
a stump and began haranguing the others, who
listened respectfully to his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if this pop-gun will carry so far,&rdquo;
remarked Archie, and before any could interfere
he took careful aim and fired. The chief&mdash;as he
seemed to be&mdash;leaped fully three feet into the air,
uttering a terrible cry, and as he fell his people
caught him in their arms. But I am sure he was
dead or desperately wounded.</p>
<p>This warning induced them all to withdraw into
the forest, where doubtless they held a council
of war.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE ESCAPE ANNIHILATION</span></h2>
<p>Meantime we nine, trapped as we were, prepared
for defense against an army of natives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it be better to use the electrites, sir?&rdquo;
inquired Joe. &ldquo;There must be three or four hundred
of those fellows, at least, and if they rush us
we won&rsquo;t stand much show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear even the electrites wouldn&rsquo;t save us in
that event,&rdquo; replied Allerton, whose face showed
anxiety for the first time. &ldquo;I think we should
stand ready to inflate our gas-jackets, however,
so if the worst happens we may escape by rising
into the air. Fortunately the pool will supply us
with water to generate the themlyne crystals. But
let us wait until all other means fail and our lives
are actually in danger.&rdquo; He turned to Chaka,
who still lay upon his face, and said: &ldquo;My brother
must resume his outfit, so as to be able to fight
with us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>The Maya made no reply, nor did he rise or attempt
to resume the clumsy garments he had discarded.</p>
<p>At Paul&rsquo;s suggestion we hastily cut a quantity
of the thick bushes and piled them high in a circle
surrounding our position&mdash;so high that we could
just stand erect and aim our rifles over the top of
the frail barricade. The bushes were no protection,
but they prevented the savages from aiming
at our bodies. The task was quickly accomplished
and then we arranged our ammunition handily
and prepared to fight as long as fighting was possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t volley,&rdquo; counseled Allerton; &ldquo;fire in
steady, regular order, according to the numbers I
will give you. Such a continual discharge is likely
to be the most effectual.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>He had scarcely finished speaking when the
Mopanes came from the forest. Depending upon
their great numbers they did not rush us, but advanced
deliberately across the clearing, chanting
a war song as they came. As soon as they were
well within range we opened fire, and nearly every
shot took effect because we were cool and cautious.
The Indians were not deterred, however, and I
remember thinking, even during the battle, that
they were especially brave in their absolute disregard
for death.</p>
<p>This last band of Mopanes was better armed
than the first. They bore battle axes and war
clubs in addition to their spears. Not a missile
was sent in our direction in response to our
fusillade, although we continued to pepper them
so persistently that the front ranks fell like grain
before a scythe, only to be trampled upon indifferently
by those following. Their plan seemed to
involve a great sacrifice of numbers that they
might finally accomplish their purpose.</p>
<p>Pedro, who had proved a poor shot, devoted
himself to recharging our repeating rifles and revolvers,
so we had no need to relax our defense to
reload. It was certainly a most dangerous predicament
in which we now found ourselves, but I
am glad to say none of us weakened or showed
nervousness. Chaka, to my surprise, took no part
in the fight at first, but as the enemy drew nearer
he sprang up and began firing with the rest of us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>On came the savages, and we kept as busy as
possible stopping all we could. Now they were a
hundred yards off; now seventy; now fifty. We
had dropped an amazing lot of them, yet still they
advanced.</p>
<p>Then a diversion occurred of so startling a
character that for a time we were utterly unable
to comprehend it. The Mopanes abruptly stopped,
turned half around until they faced the south,
from whence they had come, and without paying
any further heed to us began jabbering and gesticulating
in wild excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it up, boys!&rdquo; cried Allerton. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
getting demoralized at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was evident; yet I knew we had had no
hand in demoralizing them. The band was now
separating, darting this way and that about the
clearing as if in a panic. But the fugitives, after
a wild scramble here and there, quickly massed
again in the center of the clearing and faced outward,
their backs forming the inner part of a great
circle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Next moment the mystery was explained. From
behind every tree that bordered the open space
stepped a stalwart warrior, copper skinned and
naked save for a loin cloth. They were taller
than the Mopanes, more dignified in demeanor,
more deliberate in action. Each man was quickly
followed by another, and still another, until fully
a thousand had closed in and formed a circle
around the terrified Mopanes&mdash;as well as around
us.</p>
<p>As the first man stepped from the forest Chaka
uttered a wild cry and threw down his weapons.
Then he stood as if turned to stone, watching as
one in a dream the tragedy that ensued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles our case,&rdquo; exclaimed Archie, desperately.
&ldquo;We might have tipped over a few hundred
of those fellows, but a few thousand is too
many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had stopped firing and Paul was watching
Chaka&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we are saved,&rdquo; said he in a low voice.
&ldquo;These men are the Itzaex, who have followed the
Mopanes to seek revenge for the murder of their
atkayma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Archie; and more than one breath
of relief was drawn at this explanation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>It was not hard to understand why the Itzaex
nation had remained unconquered and supreme
through all the centuries. In strong contrast to
the chattering Mopanes they uttered no sound as
they advanced, and every warrior seemed but a
part of one great machine.</p>
<p>So far as I could determine by watching the confused
scene there was little resistance on the part
of the surprised and greatly outnumbered Mopanes.
Some made a dash for the forest, only to
be cut down; others stood their ground and fought
doggedly until an Itzaex battle-axe or a spear
thrust put an end to their further interest in the
affair.</p>
<p>In scarcely more time than I have taken to write
it the murderers of the old atkayma were virtually
annihilated. Then the victors calmly formed ranks
and faced toward us&mdash;half curiously, half expectantly.
They seemed to realize they had interfered
in our fight with the Mopanes, but as yet
they did not know whether to regard us as foes
or allies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>But now Chaka awoke to action. With a hasty
word he pressed Paul&rsquo;s hand and leaped the barrier,
advancing alone and with majestic strides
toward his people.</p>
<p>We were near enough to observe the scene
closely; almost near enough to hear every word
spoken.</p>
<p>The Itzaex seemed astonished at Chaka&rsquo;s appearance.
They looked upon him wonderingly,
and I now noticed for the first time that Chaka
alone wore a white loin cloth; those of all the
others were of some color, green and yellow predominating.</p>
<p>When the boy had almost reached them he
stopped short, lifted one arm with an imperious
gesture and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Chaka, returned to you after many days.
My father is dead. Itzaex, salute your atkayma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With one accord they knelt and prostrated
themselves, old and young alike. There was no
word of question, no display of antagonism. The
people knew and saluted their chief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Chaka slowly advanced to where the leader of
the Itzaex knelt in front of his followers. Beside
him lay the gory head of the old atkayma, the
skin of its face drawn into a horrid grin. The
boy knelt to the ghastly thing and kissed its forehead.
Now he plucked from the matted gray hair
a single heron&rsquo;s feather&mdash;the emblem of royalty&mdash;and
placed it among his own dark locks. Then
he stood erect.</p>
<p>During this scene not an Itzaex moved. Each
head touched the ground. The warriors were
silent as well as motionless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rise, my people!&rdquo; commanded Chaka, in clear,
ringing tones. They obeyed, and now a legion
of dark eyes was fixed full upon the youth confronting
them. &ldquo;The Itzaex are still brave and
dauntless,&rdquo; continued the young atkayma. &ldquo;The
Mopane cats are punished for their crime. The
murder of the great and noble Tcheltzada, my
father, who has ruled you long and wisely, has
been quickly and terribly avenged. I thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the chieftain of the party, an enormous
grizzled warrior, stepped forward and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us, then, O Atkayma, where you have
been; why now you are here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then listen to my words,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;It
is nine years since I led a band of young men to
the sea. The Mopanes fell upon us and cut my
comrades down. Some, I hope, escaped. I found
a boat and fled across the great water, the enemy
following. A ship of the white people&mdash;the powerful
Americans&mdash;saved me and took me on board,
repelling the Mopanes. I was carried to far
lands, with no way to return to my people. Years
passed by. I found a good friend among the white
men, a friend who has now helped me to come
back to you. He is yonder, with seven others who
have assisted me. On our journey to Itzlan we
were surprised by Mopanes. You may see how
many we have destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warriors glanced around. The ground was
literally covered with bodies. They well knew
they had not slain all these themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My white friends,&rdquo; continued Chaka, &ldquo;must
become the friends of the Itzaex nation; my people
must become their friends. To them you owe the
safe return of your atkayma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last statement was the first to be received
with disfavor. There were sundry grunts of protest
and gestures of dissent. The old chieftain
bowed low and made reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never, O Atkayma Chaka, has the white man
been the friend of the Itzaex,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time changes many things. These white people
have been like brothers to me,&rdquo; announced
Chaka, in a firm voice. &ldquo;I know them. In their
hearts is no treachery; they seek no conquest; they
are good and true. Tell me, Gatcha, have they
not destroyed many of the enemies of the Itzaex?
Have they not given you back your hereditary
atkayma, just as the gods have permitted my father
Tcheltzada to meet his doom? If you fail to
greet my preservers as friends, the gods, from
whom I am descended, and for whom I speak, will
surely punish you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That seemed to settle the case with the Itzaex.
Once more they prostrated themselves before
Chaka in token of obedience, and the chieftain
Gatcha said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well, O Atkayma. If your uncle, the
mighty Datchapa, receives the white men, we have
no objection to offer to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth frowned and drew himself up
haughtily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who, then, is master; my Uncle Datchapa or
Chaka?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>There was no response.</p>
<p>Chaka turned and came back to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not fear,&rdquo; he said in English. &ldquo;My people
will obey me. Come; let us go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We gathered up our traps and followed the new
atkayma to where his warriors stood awaiting us.
I observed that they regarded us who were white
with a disdain that was scarcely tolerant and decidedly
uncomfortable. Nux and Bryonia, however,
won favor immediately&mdash;doubtless because
of their color; perhaps for their imposing forms
and composed demeanor. The latter was not unlike
a notable characteristic of the Itzaex warriors.</p>
<p>Paul, who headed us, placed his right hand on
the left shoulder of the chieftain Gatcha, which
was the native salutation of peace and friendship.
The old fellow seemed pleased and gravely responded.
I followed suit, understanding this
custom was expected, and so we all in turn saluted
the warrior, who we afterward discovered was
the most famous general of the nation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Then, without more ado, we started away, our
party occupying a central position beside the
Atkayma Chaka, who stalked along with a newly
assumed dignity that was rather amusing, although
I must admit the boy had always displayed
considerable dignity.</p>
<p>The Itzaex had doubtless seen white men before,
or at least heard of them; yet I am sure the
peculiar manner in which we were garbed astonished
them. Not that they allowed themselves
to show surprise; they were too phlegmatic for
that; but even this secluded race realized that no
such queer rigging was ever worn by human creatures
before, white or black, and since they had no
reason to laugh at us they must have been impressed
with the fact that we were distinctly unusual.</p>
<p>Any present danger to us seemed now eliminated,
for with this superb escort we would surely
be able to penetrate to the heart of Itzlan, where
the capital city called Itza was located. Two days&rsquo;
journey from here, Chaka had called it; but the
Itzaex marched with such long, swinging strides
that they covered the ground more rapidly than
we have been able to do before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE ENTER THE CITY OF ITZA</span></h2>
<p>We held no unnecessary converse with one another
on the trail, not being anxious to appear as
chatterboxes before these silent natives; but when
we had camped for the night in another small
clearing, which we reached at dusk, we gathered
in a group and in English talked over the day&rsquo;s
adventures and our future prospects. Chaka came
and sat with us after he had indulged in a somewhat
lengthy interview with Gatcha the chief,
and he looked rather solemn and thoughtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father was out hunting with a small party
of twelve,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when the Mopanes, who had
long been lying in ambush, seized and assassinated
him. One warrior made escape and aroused the
City, so Gatcha gathered his men and gave chase.
Before he left Itza, however, the chief tells me
that my Uncle Datchapa, believing me to be dead,
as had my father, caused himself to be proclaimed
atkayma. That is bad, my friends, for now
Datchapa will not be glad to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is he as bad as that?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Uncle Datchapa,&rdquo; returned Chaka, slowly,
&ldquo;is an old man, and a wise man as well. He has
renown as a warrior and a statesman, and my people
respect him greatly. Also he is ambitious, and
as a boy my mother warned me to avoid him, lest
he seek my death that he might succeed my father
as atkayma. Gatcha, who has no love for Datchapa,
but fears him, tells me my father also watched
his ambitious brother carefully, being afraid to
trust him at the head of the army. Gatcha is not
sure that my uncle did not secretly send for the
Mopanes and then induce the Atkayma Tcheltzada
to hunt with a handful of followers. If this is true&mdash;but
I hope it is not true&mdash;then Datchapa will be
much disappointed when I return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Paul, soothingly. &ldquo;My
brother Chaka is the royal one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also is Datchapa royal,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;He
is my father&rsquo;s brother. But our laws forbid him
to become atkayma as long as his brother&rsquo;s son
lives.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must be careful,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not for myself, Cap&rsquo;n Sam, that I fear,&rdquo;
returned Chaka, &ldquo;but for my white comrades.
Datchapa, wicked and ambitious as he is, dare not
oppose me openly. But he is Chief of the Council,
which directs our laws, and he may show enmity
to my white friends and try to arouse the people
to destroy them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;I advise you to clap
your precious uncle into jail as soon as you arrive.
It will be the safest plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chaka made no answer to this.</p>
<p>We now began to appreciate the advantages of
the gauze protectors with which Paul had supplied
us, perhaps at Chaka&rsquo;s suggestion. The
natives had promptly built smudge fires of damp
forest leaves, in order to drive back the hordes of
mosquitoes and other insects that settled in the
camp as soon as we did. My, how those mosquitoes
did sing! The Itzaex, accustomed as they
were to the pests, squirmed and swatted the blood-suckers
continually, while we in our armor and
head-gear were proof against attack. Chaka
himself, who had seemed until now too proud to
pose before his people in any foreign attire, hastily
assumed his outfit and slept in it all night. Old
Gatcha the chief, who proved not a bad fellow on
better acquaintance, frankly expressed his admiration
for our devices and asked if we had any more
&ldquo;cages&rdquo; in the chests. Since we could not accommodate
him he lay down naked beside the smudge
of a fire and let the winged vampires bleed him at
their leisure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>All were up bright and early next morning and
so swift was our progress during the day that
when we again made camp Chaka assured us we
were but three hours&rsquo; journey from the capital.</p>
<p>During this day we passed no villages, being
told that the great City of Itza was the only congregation
of dwellings on this side of their territory.
To the west and south were a dozen or more
important towns, with cultivated fields and orchards
connecting them; but ages of warfare with
the fierce Mopanes had taught them the danger of
establishing villages in this district. Itza really
served as a barrier, it being too populous and
powerful to be attacked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Chaka estimated the total population of Itzlan
at over fifty thousand people, while the Mopanes
could number no more than ten thousand, all told.
This border warfare, however, was regarded as a
mere incident in life by the Itzaex, who had other
foes at the opposite borders of their domain. Nor
did they devote all their time to fighting; they were
mighty hunters and fishermen, as well as skilled in
agriculture and certain crude manufacturers. According
to the youthful atkayma there were no
other tribes in Yucatan so powerful and civilized
as the Itzaex, and I am inclined to think he was
right.</p>
<p>By the way, the similarity of the names Aztec
and Itzaex has induced some scholars to think
they were originally one and the same race; but
the earliest conquistadors, who knew both people,
declared that the Itzaex were much the handsomer
and more intelligent people, although their buildings
and civilization were somewhat inferior to
those of the race of Montezuma. We must take
into consideration, however, the fact that the
Spaniards were never able to penetrate far into
Itzlan, while they conquered the Aztec territory
with comparative ease&mdash;by the aid of treachery
and audacious trickery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>On the second morning we were up before the
dawn and a brisk march brought us presently to a
broad, flat plateau that was very beautiful and enticing,
as its green fields and waving grain lay
glimmering in the sun. We were all glad to be
out of the dark forests, and before long, on mounting
an incline, we saw before us the white, low
buildings of a vast city, built around the shores of
a placid lake and shaded by groups of magnificent
trees.</p>
<p>The extent of this great City of Itza amazed us
all, and Chaka smiled proudly as he pointed out
the royal palace, the great temple, and the strong
walls and gateways.</p>
<p>On nearer approach the whiteness of the buildings
became more grimy and weather-stained and
the houses were found to be generally small and
greatly scattered. We afterward learned that
Itza has a population of nearly twenty thousand,
which is certainly an extensive settlement to be
hidden in the wilds of Yucatan. The walls included
not only the buildings but the lake itself,
and were thick and strong if not very high.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Beyond the city we saw for the first time the
sierras, the highest mountains in the peninsula.
It was mainly a range of rounded knolls, most of
them being covered with verdure and easily accessible.
Directly in the center, however, were
four small rocky peaks and one towering one that
seemed to rise into the clouds. The sides of the
latter mountain seemed precipitous and formed
of straight walls of rock.</p>
<p>Runners had been sent forward and before we
reached the walls of Itza people came pouring out
of the nearest gate in a dense throng, every eye
being set in our direction. There was no confusion
or excitement apparent&mdash;I wonder if an Itzaex
ever <i>could</i> get excited?&mdash;but they plainly showed
their interest in their newly discovered youthful
atkayma by trooping out to meet him.</p>
<p>And Chaka received a right royal welcome.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Men, women and children &ldquo;bit the dust,&rdquo; as
Archie said, by prostrating themselves before him.
The boy looked very handsome in his gleaming
copper skin and the single heron feather set in his
hair, and he walked into his hereditary kingdom
as proud as a peacock, as well he might.</p>
<p>Just within the gates stood an impatient group
clad in flowing robes embroidered with colored
feather work. I think I omitted saying that most
of the people of the city wore single loose robes
similar to the togas of the ancient Greeks or the
burnous of the Egyptians. Only those engaged
in hunting or upon an expedition of war cast aside
all covering but the loin cloth.</p>
<p>A curious fact which I observed was that all
the robes were of colors or tints. Among the common
people dark blues and purples were much
affected. The merchants and middle classes, including
the warriors, wore greens and yellows.
The nobility adopted delicate shades of lavender,
rose and saffron. I saw no red, as yet. Pure
white was reserved for the royal family alone, and
the foremost figure in the group I have mentioned
was an old man arrayed in soft flowing white and
bearing over his arm another garment of like texture
and color.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>As Chaka entered the gate this ancient dignitary&mdash;I
knew at once it was his precious Uncle
Datchapa&mdash;raised an arm to bar his way and gazed
shrewdly into the young man&rsquo;s countenance. It
did not take long to convince him, for in a moment
he threw the extra robe over Chaka&rsquo;s head and
then knelt before him as the others had done. All
the group, members of the nobility and the royal
council, followed suit, and there they remained
until the new atkayma bade them rise.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that we, Chaka&rsquo;s friends and
comrades, were somewhat important and distinguished
ourselves, and entitled to consideration;
but old Datchapa and his backers disregarded us
utterly, affecting to ignore our presence. We
stuck stubbornly at the atkayma&rsquo;s heels and except
for his uncle, whom he retained at his side, all the
other big bugs were forced to fall into the procession
behind us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>A procession it really became now. Musicians
were present who blew weird sounds upon reed
flutes and beat tom-toms to keep us all in step.
The streets were lined with spectators, who
uttered no cheers of welcome but fell on their faces
automatically as Chaka approached and rose again
when he had passed on. It seemed as if we tramped
miles and miles before the royal progress finally
reached the shores of the lake, where stood the
palace. It was a great, rambling building, two
stories high and built of blocks of rough marble
with pillars and ornaments showing much clever
carving.</p>
<p>Chaka mounted the broad steps to the entrance
and then turned and addressed the crowd. He
told them how he had been carried away from
Yucatan nine years before and of how he had
managed to return. He praised his &ldquo;white
brothers&rdquo; for their noble assistance and introduced
Allerton to them especially, placing his hand on
Paul&rsquo;s shoulder in token of his friendship. He
then expressed his joy at beholding again his
native land, his sorrow at the terrible death of his
beloved father, the former atkayma, and his intention
of ruling his people wisely and with consideration.
He called upon them to prove their
allegiance and pledge their support at all times to
their royal ruler, the Child of the Gods, who
promised to protect them in return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>They answered the speech by raising their right
arms and shouting a single word: &ldquo;Kaym!&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> in
unison, after which the throng quietly dispersed.</p>
<p>Posed just before the entrance door to the
palace I had noticed three interesting figures
which, during the proceedings, had remained motionless
as statues. They were all three tall and
imposing, with sharp, thin features and alert eyes.
Their robes were of a blood-red color and had a
cape or broad collar of white. Upon their heads
they wore high, round, brimless hats of white
feather-work, the first headdresses of any sort I
had seen.</p>
<p>Chaka now turned to this trio and knelt humbly
before them. One after another placed a hand
upon his bent head and muttered a few words,
after which they all three turned and disappeared
through a small doorway.</p>
<p>The atkayma remained kneeling for several moments,
while we stood watching him. Then he
soberly regained his feet and motioned to us to
approach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me closely,&rdquo; he said in English. &ldquo;There
is danger all about you, so try to be discreet, my
brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he entered the broad arch that led into
the palace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE SIGHT THE QUARRY</span></h2>
<p>As compared with the palaces of civilized nations
I cannot say much in favor of Chaka&rsquo;s royal
dwelling. When I consider that it existed in the
heart of an isolated, practically unknown wilderness,
I admit it was something to win approval.
It must have been centuries old, for the mark of
ages was upon it everywhere, as it was upon most
of the buildings of Itza. Built of square blocks of
a coarse and unpolished but durable marble, set
with cement, there had been little attempt at architectural
display on the part of the builders. The
palace covered nearly an acre, having several
wings which had been added at different periods.
The interior was cool but dirty; the walls and
floors had never been scrubbed, I imagine. The
ceilings of the main floor were so low that I could
reach up and touch them; those on the second floor,
to which we ascended by means of a narrow, steep
stair without a rail, were more lofty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>The place was full of servants, officials and
hangers-on; but Chaka managed to recognize the
chief steward, or whatever he was called, and after
a brief interview with that factotum had us ushered
into a big bare room on the second floor, in one of
the wings.</p>
<p>We took our precious chests with us, of course,
and prepared to camp. That&rsquo;s the right word to
use, for the only furniture in the room was a row
of stone benches around the wall. Aside from the
doorway were two outside openings intended for
windows, over which a network of vines grew,
keeping out the sun but admitting light and air
and permitting us to get a limited view of the
street. Over the doorway hung a sort of portiere
of wool and feather-work, gorgeously colored.
The chamber was a primitive abode, indeed, yet
we approved it because our position could be
defended and we knew not what to expect from
the bigoted, unresponsive Itzaex.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Relying on Chaka&rsquo;s ability to protect
time, at least, we now divested ourselves of our
bulky equipment. That was a distinct relief, for
it was the first time since leaving the ship that we
had lain it aside. We replaced it with thin white
duck trousers and jackets which we had brought
along for such an occasion in one of the chests.
Ned Britton proposed strolling out and seeing the
town, but Allerton thought it wiser to remain
where we were until we had word from Chaka.</p>
<p>About noon a troop of Indian girls entered,
bearing food in various pots and earthen dishes
which they set upon the floor before us. I have
remarked upon the beauty of the male Itzaex, but
I must confess their women are not up to the
standard. Nearly all are short and dumpish in
form, with dull eyes and apathetic countenances.
I never saw a pretty Itzaex girl while I was there.</p>
<p>The food was plentiful and of good quality, but
poorly seasoned and carelessly cooked. The
meats were mutton or wild game, supplemented
by various vegetables such as rice, barley and a
root resembling turnip. The bread was heavy
and tough; but we managed to eat it, nevertheless,
and I am sure we ought to have been satisfied
for the feast was as good as the natives were able
to provide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>After dinner we waited in vain for Chaka to
come to us. As the hours rolled by Allerton began
to be uneasy and disturbed. Not until the
sun had sunk low upon the horizon and we had
come to heartily detest the blank walls of our
room did our friend, the atkayma, finally appear.
He seemed grave and thoughtful as he entered,
and after a word of greeting he squatted on the
floor before us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have kept me busy,&rdquo; he said in English.
&ldquo;I could not come before. There have been councils
and discussions all day. Just now I have come
from the great temple, where the priests have been
telling me my duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Brother!&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;It is not easy to
be a king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chaka shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that, Brother Paul,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But it is
not easy to run against the traditions of an ancient
people, to defy a powerful priesthood and stand
alone against a nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you done that, Chaka?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;I had to do it. Otherwise you would all now
be dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they object to us so strongly?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White men,&rdquo; said the atkayma, &ldquo;centuries ago
deceived my people, who destroyed them. Never
since have they permitted a white man to penetrate
into their country. Their one great hatred&mdash;greater
than that for the Mopanes&mdash;is this hatred
of the whites. When I, as the head of the nation,
brought you here, the people submitted reluctantly;
but now they demand your death&mdash;that you be
sacrificed upon the funeral pyre of my murdered
father. It is the custom to sacrifice to the gods on
such an occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose your precious uncle is at the bottom
of this,&rdquo; remarked Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has induced the priests to demand you as
sacrifices. I have just come from the great temple,
which is on an island in the lake. The priests will
not listen to my protests. They are determined to
destroy the hated white men and the blacks who
are with them. According to our law no strangers
may exist in our land or leave it alive.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll show them a trick or two,&rdquo; remarked
Ned Britton, smiling.</p>
<p>Chaka hesitated; then he added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The priests and the council have hinted that
unless you are all delivered up to them at daybreak
to-morrow morning, when my father&rsquo;s body
is to be cremated with much ceremony, they will
assassinate me, their atkayma, and place my uncle
at the head of the nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We looked at one another a little bewildered at
this. Chaka had misjudged his power over these
stubborn people, and a serious complication had
unexpectedly arisen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Allerton slowly, &ldquo;something
must be done to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chaka nodded, but made no other reply. He
sat on the stone floor, swaddled in his robe of
royalty and hugging his knees in a very unroyal
attitude. Paul eyed him thoughtfully, likewise
refraining from speech. We others knew it was
an occasion when we were not called upon to interfere
with the promoters of the expedition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Gradually the sun sank. After a brief twilight
darkness flooded the room. We were growing
impatient when Chaka slowly arose and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my Brother Paul. Also you, Cap&rsquo;n
Sam; and Cap&rsquo;n Joe, as well. We must talk. It
will be a small council. My other friends will remain
here and wait for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like dividing our party,&rdquo; said I, doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no division.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, then?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the roof above. Soon we will return.
Wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allerton, Joe and I followed the atkayma to the
door. Just outside another narrow stair led to a
small opening through which I saw a starry sky.
We ascended these stairs and stood upon a flat
roof surrounded by a low parapet.</p>
<p>The sky was a clear blue, set with myriads of
diamond stars. Already a full moon was rising
above the city, shedding its soft light so broadly
that we could clearly distinguish the surrounding
landscape. The air was dry, hot and perfectly
still.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yonder,&rdquo; said Chaka in English, as he faced
the south, &ldquo;stands the great mountain of Aota.
Around it are the four peaks of Gam. That
country is barren and covered with rocks.
There are secret caves in which dwell fierce animals
with evil spirits, and deep wells that draw
one to his death. So my people have always been
told, and they believe the tale. No Itzaex ever go
to those mountains; they are considered sacred to
the spirits of evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where lies the hidden city?&rdquo; asked Paul,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the very center of Aota, whose steep sides
it is impossible for man to climb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be a very big place,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That mountain is bigger than it seems from
here,&rdquo; declared Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Chaka; &ldquo;it is a big mountain, and
in its center, so my father told me, is a big valley
where all things beautiful grow and flourish. The
people are not many as compared with the Itzaex.
Perhaps they number a thousand&mdash;perhaps two
thousand&mdash;I do not know. But they are a powerful
race, descended from those who once came
from Atlantis, and in their valley they find all that
they need to support life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>We stood looking thoughtfully at the barren,
towering peak. No wonder elaborate preparations
had been made to invade such a stronghold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had their gold and rubies without
the trouble of going there,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Allerton, awakening to a more
alert mood, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t; and the journey must
be made. What do you propose, Chaka? Can we
steal away from the city to-night and start toward
Aota?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The atkayma shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said he, pointing below. &ldquo;The walls
are guarded by my warriors. I myself might
easily pass through, but not the white people. Already
the word has gone abroad that the priests
demand your lives. The funeral pyre of the dead
atkayma requires victims. My uncle has aroused
public hatred against you and the Itzaex nation
thirsts for your blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pleasant,&rdquo; commented Joe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the program, then?&rdquo; I inquired.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t agree to be murdered, of course, however
thirsty your people may be. That isn&rsquo;t what
we came here for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Chaka. &ldquo;We have really little to
fear. If my Brother Paul and my other friends
approve, I will show them how we may escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak, my brother,&rdquo; returned Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not wise to go to-night,&rdquo; began Chaka,
&ldquo;for I do not know the way to the mountain very
well. All I know is that by some means we must
get to the top of Aota. There is no wind. If we
ascend into the air now we will remain suspended
over the city, except for the small progress we
could make with our wings, which have never
been tested. In this country a breeze always
springs up in the morning. It blows from the
north and the north-west. That would help to
carry us away toward the mountain, or at least
far away from the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t we to be burned on the funeral
pyre at daybreak?&rdquo; demanded Joe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;At daybreak I am commanded to deliver you
to the priests at the great temple,&rdquo; said Chaka.
&ldquo;There will be many ceremonies. You will be
taken to the top of the temple, which is a pyramid,
and there, in the sight of the people below, you
are to be slain. Afterward your bodies will be
laid upon the funeral pyre. My plan is to allow
all this to happen but the killing. We will inflate
our gas-jackets in readiness and at the right time,
while the breeze is blowing, mount into the air
and escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m game,&rdquo; said I, drawing a long
breath, for I saw exciting times ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you, Chaka,&rdquo; added Joe in his quiet
voice.</p>
<p>Allerton walked to the parapet and stood there
several minutes, thinking deeply. Then he returned
and placed his hand on Chaka&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a good plan, my brother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We
will follow it to the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went below and told the others. Nux and
Bryonia grinned and nodded as if they had been
invited to attend a circus; Ned asked a few questions
and said he was satisfied; Pedro shook his
head and vowed it seemed &ldquo;ver&rsquo; much danger&rdquo;
but he would go with the crowd. Archie was
asleep and growled when we woke him up. &ldquo;Settle
it to suit yourselves,&rdquo; he said, yawning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
agreeable to anything but keeping awake all
night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>I&rsquo;m ashamed to say I slept very soundly myself,
worn out by our long journey and its excitements.
I think every one slept, for that matter,
unless it was the Mexican. When the atkayma
went away he sent us some soft mats which we
spread upon the benches and reclined upon.</p>
<p>It was still dark when Chaka again aroused us.
He was accompanied by two tall Itzaex in red
robes, who bore lighted torches. A group of
Indian maids came behind them with a simple
breakfast of fruits and milk.</p>
<p>We first ate and then proceeded to don our
equipment. There was a word of protest from one
of the priests, but Chaka silenced him and to the
amazement of the torch-bearers calmly began to
put on his own gas-jacket and electrite outfit. He
refrained from assuming the head-gear and threw
his ample robe over the other fittings, thus effectually
hiding them. I believe these priests, shrewd
as they seemed, were wholly unable to guess what
our strange apparel was for. After all, it matter
little to them, so long as we came quietly to our
fate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>When finally we were fully equipped and the
surplus material had been packed into a chest, the
atkayma produced a small but very strong cord
made from hemp, with which he proceeded to
loop us all together in a string, himself being attached
to one end and Paul to the other. Archie
began to protest at this, but Allerton told him it
was intended as an additional safeguard.</p>
<p>Then we started on, the priests going first and
Chaka following, drawing the rest of the string
after him. The ropes had been left long enough
for us to trundle the chests along easily, and so
far as I was concerned the only uncomfortable
thing was my wings, which kept getting in my
way. These had been left to dangle at our sides
until such time as we chose to thrust our arms
through the loops, in order to use them for flying.
In their folded state they did not resemble wings
at all, and although the Itzaex prided themselves
on never showing a trace of curiosity I am quite
sure we had them guessing in more ways than one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE SEEK SAFETY IN FLIGHT</span></h2>
<p>Once outside the palace we found a great concourse
of natives awaiting us, headed by some
twenty red-robed priests. In spite of the evil
looks cast upon us there was no insulting word or
jibe uttered. I gave the Itzaex credit for saving
their breath when it was not needed.</p>
<p>Although the sky had now begun to lighten and
all near-by objects were fairly distinct, the torches
were still carried ahead as we began our march.
This was brief. Soon we came to the lake and
were led upon a large flat-boat which at once set
out for the temple, urged by a score of rowers with
long paddles. The people tumbled into hundreds
of other craft, big and little, and followed at our
heels.</p>
<p>Arriving at the island the priests took us in
charge and escorted us up the steep steps forming
the side of the great temple.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>This was the largest building in Itza. It was
shaped like a pyramid, with steps on all four sides
leading to the flat top, some hundred feet from the
base. Openings here and there showed that the
center of the pyramid was divided into rooms,
where the priests doubtless dwelt and held their
secret rites and ceremonies. All great public
events, such as our proposed carving, were held on
top the temple in plain view of the populace gathered
below.</p>
<p>Just as we had reached the top&mdash;a long and
weary climb&mdash;the sun rose red over the horizon,
and at once there was a clang of gongs and bells
and a shrill blowing upon many conch-shells.
While this lasted&mdash;a full minute, perhaps&mdash;we
quietly gazed about us.</p>
<p>We stood upon a platform about fifty feet
square, the outer edge being lined with priests
standing in statuesque attitudes. In the very center
of the place was a cube of marble with a hollow
space at the top, in which lay a glistening knife.
It was not a pretty sight, I assure you, and for an
instant it made me shudder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>Now the priests set up a low chant, while at the
bottom of the steps appeared the three patriarchs
I had noticed at the palace the day before. This
was the holy triumvirate, and they ascended with
dignified deliberation while the multitude below
and those still occupying the fleet of boats all
prostrated themselves reverently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to inflate the gas-jackets, boys,&rdquo;
whispered Allerton.</p>
<p>He uncorked a canteen of water and saturated
the crystals of themlyne in his case, afterward
handing the canteen to me. One by one we all
followed suit, while the chanting priests eyed us
doubtfully but forbore to interfere. The gas generated
freely and began to fill the hollow jackets,
which swelled until we were just able to keep our
feet on the platform. Pedro let in a little too
much, and would have floated had not Chaka
quickly shut off the valve and released some of the
excess gas. Pedro, frightened at his own buoyancy,
managed to regain his feet with difficulty,
and the incident made the priests surrounding us
all the more suspicious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are your electrites ready?&rdquo; inquired Paul.</p>
<p>We nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Use them if necessary,&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<p>Then we waited. I looked anxiously for the
promised breeze, which so far had failed to put in
an appearance. But it was yet early.</p>
<p>Slowly the holy three mounted the steps and we
were all ready for them when they arrived at the
top. Scarcely glancing at us they turned to the
people and commanded them to rise, an order that
was speedily obeyed.</p>
<p>Then one of the three began a harangue in a
loud impressive voice. He said they were gathered
to witness a sad and solemn but most important
ceremony, decreed by the all-wise gods of
their fathers. The former atkayma, the noble and
wise Tcheltzada, a direct descendent of the gods,
who had ruled the nation for many years, had
finally met his fate fighting nobly against their
enemies the Mopanes, who had beheaded him. By
the command of the royal Datchapa a terrible revenge
had been taken upon the murderers and the
noble victim&rsquo;s head and body had been recovered.
These now lay at the foot of the pyramid on the
funeral pyre, and in order to please and propitiate
the gods, who had loved and cherished the great
Tcheltzada, a number of strangers, including several
of the hated white people, were to be slain and
their blood sprinkled upon the ashes of the
lamented atkayma. All this in honor not alone of
the dead, but of his son the new Atkayma Chaka
and his most holy brother, the wise and esteemed
Datchapa, who as leader of the royal council had
decreed the interesting ceremony that was about
to take place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>I could see how cleverly the priests favored old
Datchapa by giving him the credit of catering to
the people&rsquo;s hatred and lust for blood. It boded
ill for Atkayma Chaka&rsquo;s future that his wiley
uncle practically controlled the powerful priesthood.</p>
<p>As the chief priest concluded his speech he
turned about and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who condemns these prisoners to the sacrifice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; answered a voice, as Datchapa stepped
from behind a row of priests. &ldquo;As head of the
Royal Council of Itzlan I condemn these prisoners
to be slain and their blood mingled with the ashes
of Tcheltzada&mdash;if the gods consent to accept the
tribute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>At this all eyes were fixed upon an ugly little
image of the god Bac&aacute;b, which was perched upon
a shelf about midway up the front of the pyramid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the gods so consent?&rdquo; demanded Chaka in
a loud voice, taking his part in the ceremony.</p>
<p>The three priests knelt and stretched their arms
toward the grinning Bac&aacute;b, and to my astonishment
the image nodded its head in a very natural
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gods consent!&rdquo; cried aloud the three, in
unison.</p>
<p>At that moment I saw Chaka protrude the nozzle
of his electrite from his robe and point it at his
uncle. Every other eye was at that instant turned
intently upon the horrible figure of the god.</p>
<p>Suddenly old Datchapa threw up his arms and
toppled backward. He was standing near the edge
of the platform, so the people might observe his
dignified form as he condemned the prisoners, and
the result of his fall was that he began to bound
down the steps in an inert heap, slowly at first and
then with more rapid bumps and leaps until at last
he fairly rose into the air and tumbled full upon
the funeral pyre of the defunct Tcheltzada.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>A cry of horror went up as priests and populace
alike observed this dreadful scene, none able to
interfere. If the gods approved the sacrifice it
seemed like a queer way of attesting their delight.</p>
<p>There had been no sound of firearms, nothing
to indicate from whence came the blow that had
felled the royal Datchapa. While the consternation
was at its height Chaka cried aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gods disapprove! Beware, oh, Priests,
the vengeance of the gods!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a silent, repressed people, the Itzaex now
indulged in as near an approach to pandemonium
as they will ever come. Some of the natives sided
with the priests and some against them. The
priests themselves were frantic with anger not unmixed
with fear, and shrewdly realized their prestige
was at this moment in sore jeopardy. Moreover,
Chaka&rsquo;s attitude was defiant; he claimed the
whites as his friends, and whatever strange thing
had happened to Datchapa might logically be attributed
to his doing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>In a fit of unreasoning fury one of the triumvirate
caught up the knife from the altar and leaping
full upon the young atkayma strove to plunge
it into his heart. The armor prevented the blade
from penetrating, but the impact knocked Chaka
from his feet and priest and potentate were now
rolling together dangerously near to the steps.
Ned caught Chaka&rsquo;s leg and saved him, and as the
priest clung to his victim and again raised the
wicked blade to strike I sent a charge from my
electrite against him and he quit the struggle then
and there.</p>
<p>But it was war, now, and no mistake. With a
savage growl the whole posse of priests was upon
us, and what we did in the next few seconds
startled us almost as much as it did our audience.
Every man brought his electrite into full play and
we mowed down the red-robed rascals like blades
of grass. So effective was the electric current discharged
that the victims had no time to even gasp:
they simply tumbled down and lay still. Moreover,
the charge spread at such close quarters, like
small shot from a blunderbus, and one charge
sometimes paralyzed three, or even four, at a time.
A few fell upon the steps, but none experienced
the sensational descent of old Datchapa. Before
we realized it the platform was cluttered with motionless
bodies and not one enemy remained erect
or animate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Our remarkable victory ought to have won the
admiration and applause of the people; but it
didn&rsquo;t. On the contrary the natives burst into a
hoarse roar of ferocious rage and with a single
impulse started up the pyramid.</p>
<p>From all sides they rushed, vengeful and furious,
and we decided not to await their coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn on the stop-cocks and let more gas into
your jackets,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;Be careful not to get
too much&mdash;just enough to float us comfortably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the breeze?&rdquo; I asked as I obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the breeze. Let&rsquo;s get off this
hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the chests, sir?&rdquo; inquired Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chaka and I will inflate their coverings. Hurry,
my lads&mdash;there&rsquo;s no time to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>Roped together as we were it was funny to see
the effect of adding to the gas already in our jackets.
Nux and Bryonia, accustomed to prompt
obedience, were first to float, and each held on
to a chest until that, too, was rendered light enough
to float. Ned and his chest soared next; then
Archie, Joe and I went up. Pedro&rsquo;s chest started
upward and he lost hold of its handles. I don&rsquo;t
know whatever would have become of that precious
box had not Archie grabbed its wheel as it
went by and held on to it like grim death. Next
moment Chaka and Allerton together left the top
of the pyramid; but something was wrong with
Pedro; he could not find the cock that admitted
the gas to his jacket.</p>
<p>He was roped between Bryonia and Ned, and
his weight threatened to hold us all anchored when
Paul and Chaka, on the ends of the string, appreciating
the danger, turned more gas into their own
jackets and drew big Pedro gradually off his feet.
Slowly&mdash;too slowly, altogether&mdash;we rose into the
air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>The Itzaex, during this time, had been scrambling
up the sides of the pyramid. Now the foremost
to reach the top, a big, powerful fellow, made
a leap and grasped Pedro by the leg, anchoring
the lot of us again, although the Indian could not
drag us down, but hung clinging while Pedro
swore and kicked at him with the other foot.</p>
<p>I thought this was a good time to work my
electrite, and down fell the Indian, crumpling several
of his fellows who had rushed forward to help
him, while our anxious bunch gained new headway
and slowly mounted skyward. Ned found
the supply cock and gave Pedro&rsquo;s jacket its full
allowance of gas; so now we kept together better
and were soon a good fifty feet above our starting
place and perhaps a hundred and fifty feet above
the ground of the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s high enough,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;Press the
valves gently, each one of you, and let out gas until
we cease to rise&mdash;but not enough to start a
descent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We did the best we could, but some of course
blundered and lost too much gas, being then obliged
to let in a new supply. Finally, however, we
had both the chests and ourselves in a condition
of &ldquo;statue quo&rdquo; and hung motionless just above
the pyramid. It was a queer sensation to be &ldquo;up
in the air&rdquo; like this. I felt a bit dizzy at first, and
I noticed poor Pedro kept his eyes shut as if
afraid to look down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Few of the Itzaex were armed that day, as none
had expected a fight; so except for a few darts
hurled toward us with uncertain aim we were not
molested. It was interesting, though, to look
down and see that great pyramid black with human
beings who stood in amaze watching our
aerial exhibition. The Itzaex are not easily astonished,
but I&rsquo;m sure we had them going just
then, and small wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes the breeze!&rdquo; cried Paul, suddenly.
&ldquo;Get your wings ready, lads, and head for that tall
mountain. Now&mdash;all together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The breeze came almost directly from the north
and caught us so abruptly that it fluttered our
string of adventures like rags on a clothesline before
we collected our wits and made ready to take
advantage of it. I got my arms through the
loops, spread my wings and tried my best to flop
them as a bird would.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>I now realized the wisdom of connecting us
together, for we were all new to the use of these
curious wings and worked them in so many diverse
ways that had we been independent of one another
we soon would have become hopelessly separated.
As it was, the more successful flyers dragged on
the others, and the wind impartially dragged us
all on together; so after a few moments, when I
remembered to look back, I found the pyramid and
its mass of humanity a good mile distant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>In the last few weeks I&rsquo;ve been reading about
aeroplanes and airships, and what has been accomplished
with them. How imperfect&mdash;how
futile and absurd&mdash;they all seem when compared
with the Wells Gas-Jacket and Fibre Wings. All
their intricate machinery, their rudders and ballast,
accessories and paraphernalia are sure to give
place to the eminently practical and satisfying
mode of aerial navigation which I believe we were
the first to employ during our adventurous trip to
Yucatan. Allerton, who was more expert than
the others, soon unfastened the cord and began to
fly independently, and the ease with which he did it
was marvelous. Using the wings to guide him,
as a bird does, he let the stiff breeze carry him
along with remarkable swiftness, tacking sidewise
as he pleased and following any direction his fancy
dictated. He would not let the rest of us cut loose,
though, but explained to us the theory of his flight
and taught us by example how to control our
wings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE INTERVIEW THE RED-BEARD</span></h2>
<p>The mountain, Chaka stated, was four days&rsquo;
journey from the City of Itza. This was because
the country surrounding the barren peak was rugged
and very difficult to traverse. Yet our path
through the air was so smooth and our speed so
great that it was early in the afternoon when we
approached so near to Aota that caution induced
us to descend and call a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here lies the goal of all our struggles,&rdquo; said
Paul. &ldquo;From this moment we must exercise great
care in all we do, for we cannot afford to risk
failure by an error of judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>After counseling with Chaka, Allerton decided
to land on the west side of the mountain, about
half way to the summit. By a careful manipulation
of our wings and gradually letting the gas
from our jackets we managed to accomplish this
in safety, and although we lit upon the rocks about
half a mile from the spot we had first selected we
were well satisfied with the result of our exciting
trip.</p>
<p>No wonder the Itzaex never ventured near
Mount Aota. Such a jumble of huge jagged
rocks, treacherous precipices, canyons, rifts and
caverns I have never seen before nor since. As
we settled to the ground we saw no place level or
large enough to hold us all, except a deep ravine;
so we fluttered down into this and planted our feet
upon a pebbly bottom through which a torrent
rushed during the rainy season, but which was now
dry as a bone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a bad hiding place, from which to reconnoiter,&rdquo;
remarked Paul, when we had all seated
ourselves to rest and take breath, for flying is
rather strenuous when long continued. &ldquo;What do
you think, Chaka; shall we make our camp here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us find water,&rdquo; suggested the atkayma.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>So we set off in pairs and in different ways to
discover water, leaving Pedro to guard the chests.
Archie and I walked up the canyon together, finding
many fissures leading from it and many dark
caverns appearing in the rocks; but no where was
there evidence of water. After proceeding a half
mile or so we returned to find all the party again
congregated. Nux and Bryonia alone had been
successful, having found a way to climb up the
lower side of the ravine, from whence they descended
the mountain a short distance and reached
a spring of clear, cold water that bubbled out of a
rift in the rock. Quite near was the mouth of a
large cave, which they did not wait to explore.</p>
<p>As this spot seemed the most suitable location
for a camp we took the chests and made our way
laboriously out of the ravine and down the mountain
a few hundred feet to the spring, where we all
drank of the water eagerly. There was but a narrow
ledge to give us foothold here, so we approached
the cave, the mouth of which appeared
just where the ledge ended.</p>
<p>A few paces from the entrance the cavern was
black as ink; so Paul got out his lamp&mdash;a modern
acetylene search-light affair&mdash;and lighted it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get your weapons ready,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for we
don&rsquo;t know who lives in this mansion, or whether
the owner is willing to take boarders. Don&rsquo;t use
firearms; we&rsquo;re too near the Tcha city for that.
If you have to defend yourselves shoot the electrites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The search-light soon cast its gleam to the further
wall, and we decided the cave was vacant. A
slight rustling sound now reached our ears, growing
gradually louder in volume, and looking downward
I saw dozens of snakes wriggling toward us,
hissing venomously as they came. They were tiny
things, not much bigger around than a lead pencil
and some seven or eight inches long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reetee!&rdquo; shouted Chaka, springing backward.
&ldquo;Run, friends&mdash;run for your lives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no, my brother,&rdquo; answered Paul, restraining
him. &ldquo;We are well protected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chaka shuddered, but stood his ground, watching
the serpents fearfully. They struck at our feet
and legs continually, not coiling but throwing
themselves forward by rising upon their tails.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Although the sheathing of our shoes and gaiters
was impervious to their fangs, the attack was too
horrible not to resent. With one accord we began
trampling them under heel, destroying the creatures
by scores. But the more we killed the more
appeared, creeping upon us from numberless tiny
cracks in the walls. They came straight to the
attack, fighting mad at being disturbed, and we
soon began to tire of the hopeless battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s cut it!&rdquo; said Archie, and there was no
dissenting voice. Gradually we withdrew toward
the mouth of the cave, the snakes following persistently,
until when we stood upon the ledge it
looked as though we must abandon the position
and seek another camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>are</i> the things, anyhow?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reetee,&rdquo; said Chaka; &ldquo;the most deadly serpents
known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nux and Bryonia knew snakes pretty well, having
had large experience with them in the South
Seas. Bry begged Allerton to give him the key
to the supply chest, and going to it he searched for
and brought out a package of dry mustard. Then
he took the lamp and re&euml;ntering the cavern with it,
the black kicked the bodies of the dead and dying
serpents together in a heap and scattered over it
fully half the mustard the package contained. Next
moment he came running back to us, and was
none too soon, for with a rush the vermin attacking
us wriggled back into the cave, where they
made straight for the mustard heap, burying their
fangs in the carcasses of their damaged brethren.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>The result was astonishing. Almost instantly
the deadly reetee succumbed to &ldquo;mustard poison,&rdquo;
as our blacks gravely called it, and in five minutes
that lot of harmless mustard&mdash;harmless to us, that
is&mdash;had accomplished more than our boot-heels
could do in a week. The odor of the mustard drew
every serpent from its hiding place, and contact
with the yellow powder was its death warrant.
We didn&rsquo;t care for the cave, with its horrid carpet
of dead reetee, but at least we were now free from
the vipers&rsquo; attacks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t stay here, or
anywhere else on the mountain, for long. Even
if our approach has not been observed, which we
have little reason to hope, the spies of the Tcha,
which are certainly on the lookout, will soon locate
us. So it is necessary we get into the hidden city
as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On which side of the mountain is the entrance?&rdquo;
I asked Chaka.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think there is any entrance,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;at least, none that is known to those outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet your father visited this city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many years ago, when he was a young warrior.
At that time he and his band had taken a
fancy to hunt on this mountain and began to climb
it in search of game. One night, as they lay sleeping,
all were seized and bound. Then, being
blindfolded they were carried bodily through what
seemed to be a long passage. In the morning their
bonds were removed and they found themselves
within the splendid hidden city of the Tcha. A
council was held, at which it was decided to kill all
but my father, the atkayma of the Itzaex. He
was made to promise that he would never mention
the secret of the existence of the city to any but his
son or his successor who would rule his nation in
his place after him. Ever, during his life and the
lives of his successors, he was to prevent any of the
Itzaex or other people from wandering near to
this mountain. Under these conditions his life
would be spared and he would be sent back to his
home. Of course my father promised, and the
next night was blindfolded and led through other
passages, finding himself alone at daylight at the
very foot of the mountain. He told me all this,
so that I could fulfill his pledge when I became atkayma;
but he would tell me nothing of the people
of Tcha, except that they were a wonderful race
and their city was magnificent with gold and beautiful
red gems. Some few details I gleaned from
him, but aside from what I have now told you I
know nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the thing is all hearsay. There
is no positive proof that within the steep and forbidding
walls of this mountain lies any city at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chaka looked at me reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father, the atkayma, never lied,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that, old man. He might have
got a crack on the head, and dreamed it all. Or
the things he saw may have impressed him, an
ignorant savage, as more wonderful than they
really were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the story, Sam,&rdquo; said Allerton,
sharply. &ldquo;Indeed, I have risked my life and future
happiness upon its truth. Why should you
doubt?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t Paul,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen too
many queer things to doubt anything but the commonplace.
But you must admit it&rsquo;s a rather
flimsy story to base such great hopes on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were sitting on the chests on the narrow
ledge, talking in this manner, when Bry, who was
facing the cliff that rose sheer above us, uttered a
cry and pointed upward.</p>
<p>We all turned, to stare in astonishment.</p>
<p>Not ten yards distant, upon a tiny shelf of rock
that looked like a bracket jutting out from the
cliff, squatted a man.</p>
<p>He was clothed in a white toga which had a
border of deep blue. His hair and a long beard
that swept to his knees was golden red. His
eyes were large and blue in color, his features
regular, expressive and intelligent. Strangest of
all <i>his skin was white as our own</i>!</p>
<p>I could not see that he bore any arms, but while
he might not be very tall, if standing erect, the
muscles that showed in his bare arms and neck
convinced me he was powerfully built and strong
as an ox.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Silently he sat, his knees clasped by his brawny
hands, and even when he found himself observed
he gave no start nor evidence of emotion.</p>
<p>The situation became rather embarrassing to us
at last, for while we were objects of the man&rsquo;s
earnest scrutiny&mdash;a scrutiny that seemed to search
out and analyze our very thoughts&mdash;his composed
countenance offered us little information in return.</p>
<p>Chaka, as the important member of our party,
just then, stood up and bowed with great solemnity.
Speaking the Maya tongue, common to all
the tribes throughout Yucatan, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I greet a friend. May peace reign between
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If our god so decrees,&rdquo; was the reply, in a
deep, resonate voice. This was an established
Maya form of greeting among strangers. Said
Chaka, continuing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence do you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My foot was planted here before your own. It
is for you to say from whence you came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man spoke quietly, without a trace of curiosity
in his tone. Doubtless he did not require
information concerning us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am Chaka, Royal Atkayma of the Itzaex,&rdquo;
returned our spokesman. &ldquo;These companions are
from countries beyond the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red-beard nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little is there on bleak Aota to reward you
for your journey,&rdquo; he remarked. It seemed he
spoke the native language as well as Chaka did.
&ldquo;May the gods of your fathers direct you upon
your return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was hard to answer this hint and say we were
not going back just then. We had no doubt that
before us perched an inhabitant of the hidden city,
one of the mysterious and ancient race of Tcha.
Remembering the report of Chaka&rsquo;s father that
spies were detailed to guard the mountain from
intrusion we at once decided that this fellow was
of this class. He would have had poor eyes, indeed,
had he not noted our aerial approach, and
his presence was now to be attributed to his desire
to warn us against ascending the mountain farther.</p>
<p>As for our being able to get much information
from him, the task seemed hopeless; but Allerton,
addressing us in a low voice in English, said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to ask this man some questions.
Now that he has discovered us I can see no harm
in trying to pump him. He will report our presence
to his superiors, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; I responded significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to hurt him, for heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
warned Allerton. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to antagonize
these people in any way. Our cue is to make
them our friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had my own opinion concerning that, but said
nothing.</p>
<p>The lieutenant now turned to the man above
us, speaking the Maya to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The legends say that the ancient race of Tcha
still exists, hidden somewhere near here. Your
presence leads us to believe the tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your skin is white; you are not of the Maya
race,&rdquo; continued Paul.</p>
<p>The man remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we not visit your people, and greet them
as friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red-beard shook his head. &ldquo;You talk in riddles,&rdquo;
he replied coolly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;A white skin in Yucatan is unusual,&rdquo; hinted
Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet five of you have white skins,&rdquo; answered
the other, not giving our sun-browned Mexican
credit for belonging to our race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are Americans,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;Soon we
shall return to our own country, far away, from
whence we came. It would please us, since we
are here, to meet your people, who have so long
secluded themselves from the great world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red-beard made no reply to this. He did
not refuse to answer any direct question, but
would not argue or give us any satisfaction in
return for our friendly advances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ask to be taken to your city,&rdquo; continued
Paul.</p>
<p>The man sat motionless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you refuse our reasonable request we will
find the way without your guidance,&rdquo; Allerton
went on in a firm voice. He was getting provoked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case you will sacrifice your lives,&rdquo; came
the threatening rejoinder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said our leader, bluntly. &ldquo;Our lives
are not to be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused abruptly, for the ledge was vacant.
The Tcha had disappeared as if by magic.</p>
<p>With a bound Bryonia leaped up and caught a
projecting rock from which he swung himself to
the shelf the red-beard had occupied. Then he
also disappeared and we waited anxiously the result
of his quest. A few moments later the black
protruded his head and shook it gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dey&rsquo;s a tunnel heah,&rdquo; he announced; &ldquo;but it
blocked up good an&rsquo; tight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chaka and Allerton both investigated, we
standing below to &ldquo;boost&rdquo; them to the shelf.
When they came back they reported that a small
tunnel, merely a crevice, in fact, led into the cliff
for a distance of about twenty feet and then
ended in a solid wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it isn&rsquo;t solid,&rdquo; added Paul, &ldquo;for the
fellow evidently escaped that way and lowered a
big stone to block the tunnel. But from this side
it is impossible to remove the obstruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, what next?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us wait here until darkness falls. It isn&rsquo;t
a very comfortable location, I admit, but it will
do for a few hours. Then we will inflate our
jackets, rise to a level with the top of the mountain,
descend into the city, and take our chances
of receiving an affectionate welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We considered this plan thoughtfully and after
discussing it in all its phases decided it was best
to follow, under the peculiar circumstances.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE BECOME PRISONERS OF THE TCHA</span></h2>
<p>Without doubt our presence on the mountain
and our declared intention of visiting the hidden
city was by this time known to the Tcha. Our
best policy would be to appear among them at
once, rather than wait for them to formulate a
plan to prevent our purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be very fierce people, if the others
are like the sample we&rsquo;ve seen,&rdquo; remarked Archie.
&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t at all a bad looking fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I would rather face the Tcha than
tackle the Itzaex again,&rdquo; added Ned Britton.
&ldquo;We know how to deal with white folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not forget that the Tcha killed my father&rsquo;s
followers without mercy,&rdquo; said Chaka. &ldquo;But
that need not discourage us. We made the journey
to gain this hidden city, and my brother
Paul&rsquo;s plan to fly over the mountain seems to me
to be wise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>Our thoughts were none too cheerful as we sat
there hour after hour and discussed the forlorn
hope, perhaps imagining more terrors than actually
existed. It was a big mountain. We could
realize that, now we had reached it and were
perched like birds upon a narrow ledge of rock,
with a dangerous precipice at our feet. There
was room for a pretty big city inside the grim
walls of this barrier, if it really was hollow and
a city of living people existed within it.</p>
<p>We brewed some coffee over an alcohol stove
and Paul made enough extra to fill his thermos
bottles. In the supply chest&mdash;one of the four we
carried&mdash;was a quantity of food in very condensed
form. By boiling water brought from the spring
we made some very excellent soup from a small
tablet, and a tin of beef, with a biscuit apiece, enabled
us to feast in a very satisfactory manner.</p>
<p>All our operations had to be conducted on a
shelf of rock not two feet wide, and the place was
so littered with the carcasses of the vipers we had
killed that the only way to sit or lie down was
by perching upon the chests.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>Gradually the sun sank and twilight fell.
Nearly all of us were impatient to start as soon
as possible, but Allerton restrained us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have waited long and endured much to
gain this position,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It would be reckless
folly to spoil our prospects now by acting prematurely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we waited, hour after hour, until the
patience of even our staid blacks was well-nigh
exhausted. Archie grumbled and growled continually,
while Joe whistled softly to himself.
Pedro fell asleep and only escaped falling into the
precipice by Ned&rsquo;s quick grasp on his arm as he
was rolling off a chest.</p>
<p>Finally Allerton looked at his watch for the
twentieth time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midnight,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I think we may
risk it now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>We were getting used to the trick of inflating
our gas-jackets. In a few moments each man
was a miniature balloon, with wings ready to
direct his flight. We expanded the coverings of
the chests until they floated gently, and were
about the same weight as the air itself. Then we
examined our electrites, to which we all attached
fresh storage belts, saw that guns and revolvers
were loaded and in working order, and then were
prepared to undertake the most important phase
of our adventure.</p>
<p>The moon was up again and the stars bright
and gleaming. While we might have preferred
darkness, if allowed a choice, we were obliged to
make the best of a night that seemed alive and
thrilling with heavenly radiance. We could see
what we were doing, anyway, and since we were
exploring an unknown country that fact was comforting
to a degree.</p>
<p>Once more we looped ourselves together by
means of the cord, and then at Allerton&rsquo;s command
we turned on the gas until we began to float
gently upward.</p>
<p>Using our wings, which were becoming less
awkward to us, we guided ourselves toward the
center of the mountain top. Within a quarter of
an hour we were poised directly over it.</p>
<p>And now, indeed, we not only recognized the
truth of Chaka&rsquo;s report, derived from his father,
but were filled with amazement at what we beheld.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>Within the walls of the great mountain lay a
deep cup, or valley, the surrounding peaks forming
its bulwark or wall of defense, and effectually
shutting out the outside world. And in the
valley, as it was disclosed to our eyes under the
moonlight, were trees, rivers and fields of verdure
and of grain.</p>
<p>But in a great circle following the oblong
shape of the valley and extending from the walls
of the mountain a quarter of a mile or so toward
the center, was the city we had sought, brilliant
with thousands of electric lights. The buildings
were constructed of white, highly polished
marble, not being flat or square as were the
dwellings of Itza, but having towers, gables, and
minarets, and presenting many novel and beautiful
designs of architecture. The streets&mdash;both
the circular ones extending around the valley and
the cross streets&mdash;were broad and smooth as our
American boulevards, and were lined with splendid
shade trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>It was an impressive sight from our bird&rsquo;s-eye
position, this handsome city, and quaint enough
to rank with any European town of ancient date.
But it was altogether more fantastic than even
the Chinese towns I had visited, and being built
like a belt, following the outlines of the enclosing
mountain, it certainly presented a most unique
appearance.</p>
<p>The City of the Tcha, with its central rural or
country district, may be roughly estimated at four
miles in length and from three to three and one-half
miles wide, which proves what a big
mountain Aota really was.</p>
<p>Allerton&rsquo;s sharp eyes eagerly examined the
place and he presently whispered to us instructions
to descend at a point as near to the central
portion of the valley as possible, in this way
avoiding the city.</p>
<p>We could not now hope to find the population
asleep, seeing that the twinkling lights were
everywhere. Although a few buildings of one
sort or another were scattered here and there
throughout the rural district&mdash;otherwise the center
of the valley&mdash;these would be easy to avoid
until we had landed and taken our bearings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>We did not hesitate long, but pressed the
escape-valves and began to descend. Pedro,
whose mechanical understanding was sadly undeveloped,
made his usual blunder and nearly
precipitated us to the ground in a heap by dragging
at the ropes; but Paul&rsquo;s cleverness managed
to save us from injury, so that we all landed a bit
abruptly but safely upon a greensward, while
Pedro got a severe bump that nearly drove the
breath from his body.</p>
<p>Instantly we removed the ropes and peered
about us to discover where we were. A low,
white building, all unlighted, was a few yards
away; we were upon the broad and velvety lawn
surrounding it. Near by ran a small brook,
spanned by artificial bridges of pretty design.
There were flower beds beyond the brook and a
driveway or road circled to the end of the nearest
bridge. The air was delightfully cool, a hush lay
upon the whole country and the entire scene was
peaceful and charming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>While we stood there taking our bearings I
happened to turn toward the low building,
wondering for what purpose it was used, when I
observed a door open, and a file of men pour out
in rapid succession. They separated into two
files, with the evident intention of surrounding
us.</p>
<p>My cry of warning was scarcely necessary, for
now we were all watching these files. Tall, stalwart
fellows they were, clothed in white togas
similar to the one the red-beard we had first seen
wore. Circular casques, fitting tightly to their
heads, glittered brightly in the moonlight and in
their arms the Tcha carried spears with silver
shafts and heads of gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, shall we fight, Paul?&rdquo; I asked hurriedly,
as I fingered my electrite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Let us see first what their intentions
are. We come here in peace. If we declare war
now we may ruin all our chances of trading for
the treasure we have journeyed so far to obtain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tone was one of subdued excitement. We
were all of us intensely nervous and wrought up
by this outcome of our extraordinary adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>Silently but with remarkable swiftness the
Tcha surrounded us; then, turning abruptly and
with admirable military precision, they faced us
and advanced until they formed a close circle but
a few paces distant. For our part we made no
move to escape nor to oppose them. With all
the dignity and assumed confidence we could
muster we stood with folded arms, silently regarding
them.</p>
<p>The spears grounded on the grass with a slight
thud. Every man became a living statue. Then
a young fellow stepped to the front and saluted.</p>
<p>His complexion was white and he wore a short
red beard. This fairly describes the entire company
he commanded. The light was sufficient
for us to see them clearly, and to note the expression
on their faces. It was composed and calm.
I have never seen people so alert and yet so
sedate and dignified as these ancient Tcha. In
action they are marvelously quick; in repose as
motionless as if carved from stone.</p>
<p>Allerton advanced a pace and returned the
young officer&rsquo;s salute.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we intrude,&rdquo; he said in the Maya language,
&ldquo;we offer our apologies. We are travelers from
the United States of America, come to examine
this unknown part of Yucatan. We claim from
you and your people the same hospitality we
would show to you were you to visit our own
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer listened respectfully. When Allerton
had concluded his speech the other said,
using the same language:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am instructed to furnish you lodgings for
the night. Follow as I lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was clear and distinct, his tone arbitrary,
as if he anticipated no opposition and
would brook none. Yet the words seemed fair
enough, and in return Paul merely bowed his
assent.</p>
<p>We were conducted to the building from
whence the soldiers had issued, the men forming
a hollow square and escorting us while we
marched in the center. It looked to me very like
a capture, but Paul whispered to us in English
not to resent anything at the present time.</p>
<p>Through the doors we were ushered into a big
dark hall, where we stood until suddenly a light
flashed ahead of us and its rays disclosed surroundings
of a most magnificent character.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; commanded the officer, leading the
way up the hall. We obeyed, turned a bend in
a corridor and found ourselves in a room about
twenty feet square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the morning,&rdquo; said the young Tcha,
tersely, &ldquo;I will again come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saluted once more, backed through the door
and closed it behind him. We heard a metallic
sound, as if a heavy bar had fallen into place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prisoners, sure enough!&rdquo; exclaimed Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a gorgeous
prison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was, indeed. The walls and floor were of
polished marble, but the former were draped with
splendid hangings and the latter spread with
thick, soft rugs. Couches covered with downy
cushions&mdash;enough for us all&mdash;stood here and
there, and these were made of a metal that Allerton
declared to be solid gold. Save for an ornamental
table of similar material these couches
were the only furniture of the room. In the
center of the ceiling glowed a curious flat-shaped
electric lamp that lighted the place fully, but without
any disagreeable glare. I saw no way to
shut it off, but Joe discovered in a corner a cord
which, when gently pulled, drew a mask over the
lamp and darkened the room. We afterward
discovered that this room was really plain and
unprepossessing when compared to even the
humbler dwellings of this magnificent city, but at
the moment of our introduction to it we regarded
its splendor with awe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>There was one window, letting into a court.
It had no glass panes but was crossed and recrossed
by heavy bars of a metal resembling
bronze. There was no way to remove these bars
and, the door having been securely fastened, we
were forced to admit that we had been very
securely jailed. Later we learned that this building
was reserved for a prison, or as near such an
institution as the Tcha required. It was called
&ldquo;The House of Seclusion&rdquo; where offenders were
sent for punishment; but it was very seldom used.</p>
<p>It was no use worrying. Here we were, at
last, in the hidden city. Young men require
lots of sleep. I settled myself upon one of the
gold framed couches and was soon oblivious to
every threatened danger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE VIEW THE HIDDEN CITY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I make coffee?&rdquo; I heard Paul ask.</p>
<p>Opening my eyes I found the sun streaming
through the barred window. The others except
Archie and Pedro were awake.</p>
<p>As if to answer our leader&rsquo;s question steps were
heard on the marble floor of the passage outside.
Bars were removed, the door swung open and in
came four soldiers bearing our breakfast.</p>
<p>This consisted of fresh sweet milk, a plentiful
supply of fruits, including peaches, dates and
melons, and a quantity of excellent bread made
into small loaves and baked with a hard crust.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>I made a mental examination of these strange
people as they arranged the food upon the table.
Their complexions were much fairer than my
own, which was well browned by sun and
weather; yet they lived in a tropical climate.
Every Tcha we had seen so far had red hair, and
I may as well add that every Tcha we saw afterward,
male and female, possessed red hair, with
its invariable accompaniment of blue eyes. They
were very careful of their personal appearance,
being as neat as wax from head to toe. The
casques of these soldiers, who also acted as police&mdash;they
were called &ldquo;public guardians&rdquo;&mdash;were
formed of plates of gold hardened by means of
some alloy.</p>
<p>As soon as they had performed their duties
these men withdrew, leaving us to gather round
the golden table, pouring milk from a golden
tankard into golden goblets and eating from
golden plates. All these utensils were skillfully
engraved with conventional decorative designs,
no figures or landscapes being used whatever.
Around the base of the tankard was set a row of
brilliant red stones which Paul after examination
pronounced rubies of almost priceless purity and
size.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s almost enough wealth here in this
room,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to repay us for coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s take it and go,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Can</i> we go?&rdquo; inquired Chaka.</p>
<p>Not just then, I realized perfectly.</p>
<p>After giving us ample time for our breakfast
the young officer reappeared. He was accompanied
by a single soldier bearing over his arm a
number of white togas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am commanded to take the strangers before
the Tribunal,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;We are ready to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must go unarmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a signal from Allerton we laid down our
guns and revolvers, drew our knives and placed
all in a heap upon the floor. We stuck to the
electrites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remove your flying clothes,&rdquo; commanded the
officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We refuse to do that,&rdquo; said Paul, firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must go before the Tribunal naked, save
for these robes I have brought,&rdquo; was the stern
decree.</p>
<p>Paul smiled and sat down indifferently upon
a sofa.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we won&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You must
remember, my good man, that our customs are
not the same as your own. We are neither your
prisoners nor your slaves, but your guests. We
will submit to no indignities at your hands, sir.
If you so desire, we will wear the robes you have
brought, but only over our other garments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer bowed, turned on his heel and left
the room, his attendant following.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to treat &rsquo;em,&rdquo; cried Archie,
jubilantly. &ldquo;When they find we&rsquo;re not to be
bulldozed they&rsquo;ll show us more respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not many of us were so optimistic. I did not
like the look on the officer&rsquo;s face as he retired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has probably gone to report and receive
further orders,&rdquo; said Paul, a bit anxiously. &ldquo;I
think I was right to be so positive, but it is hard
to judge these people. One thing is certain, we
mustn&rsquo;t give up our electrites or gas-jackets.
If it comes to open war at any time I am confident
these devices will save us and permit us to
escape.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>We all fully agreed with him in this, and having
planned and discussed our actions in case of
emergencies we settled down to wait, as patiently
as might be, the course of events.</p>
<p>Suddenly a shutter swung across the window
with a click, shutting out the light and leaving
us in darkness. I felt my way to the cord, drew
the mask from before the electric lamp and so
lighted the room artificially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what that was for?&rdquo; exclaimed
Paul, uneasily, as we all stared at the shutter
before the window. &ldquo;Can you explain it,
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chaka shook his head. &ldquo;The Tcha queer
people. It is not easy to understand them,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>A fragrance, as of some delightful perfume,
was now wafted to our nostrils from some hidden
source. We all noticed this, but no one made
any remark at first. The perfume grew stronger,
presently, and more pungent. I was sitting on
a couch and threw myself back against the cushions,
feeling drowsy and inert. My eyes closed;
I felt a delicious sense of oblivion stealing over
me. Somewhere out of space I heard Paul&rsquo;s voice
saying:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;Resist it! resist this fatal essence, or we are
lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had no especial desire to resist anything.
Just then I felt entirely comfortable and contented.
Dreams were coming to me; dreams
rose-colored and sweet. I wandered in cool
forests, picking brilliant wild flowers and listening
to the songs of birds. The songsters were
Birds of Paradise, superbly plumed, and they sat
on the branches of trees and talked, as well as
sang, telling me pretty fables. Other delights I
enjoyed, wading in a clear brook and catching
fishes in a straw hat, as I once did as a small boy.
Then I leaped upon a green bank and raced up
and down in thoughtless glee.</p>
<p>Some one caught me and began shaking me
with no gentle hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam! Sam, my lad! Wake up&mdash;wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In much disgust at being disturbed I opened
my eyes. Sunshine again in the room. The
shutter had been removed from the window. Joe
was bending anxiously over me, while black Nux
fanned me gently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>The dream dissolved. I sat up, quickly recovering
my wits.</p>
<p>All but Nux and Joe were still asleep under
the influence of the powerful narcotic which had
filled the room. I ran to Paul and began to
shake and fan him. Joe tackled Archie and Nux
tried to restore Chaka. Bry came to unassisted
and presently joined us.</p>
<p>Five minutes later we had all recovered and
sat staring at one another in bewilderment. There
was no trace of headache or other bodily ill-effect
from our enforced loss of consciousness; but a
far greater misfortune had overtaken us.</p>
<p>We had been stripped naked while we slept and
all our equipment and outfit, defensive and aggressive,
including the four chests, had been taken
from us.</p>
<p>We were helpless prisoners in the hidden city
of the Tcha.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>Whatever confidence in ourselves we had felt
before we endured this irreparable loss was now
reduced to a minimum. I am quite sure there
was not a coward among us, as the term is generally
understood; but our present predicament
was serious enough to make the bravest of the
brave anxious and despondent.</p>
<p>We said nothing for a time. There was nothing
to say. Archie, who usually grumbled and
complained, now startled us by an abrupt laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What fools we were to think we could outwit
these Tcha,&rdquo; he said, in a voice that was positively
cheerful. &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t been hidden from the
world all these thousands of years without getting
a little civilized in their own way; and, by jinks!
it was as clever a dodge as I ever heard of. No
threats, no force, no back-talk. They laid down
the law to us, and found we wouldn&rsquo;t agree to it.
So they made us come to time, in the pleasantest
possible manner. They deserve to win, those fellows.
Hurrah for the Tcha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m inclined to think,&rdquo; said Allerton, with a
sigh, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all up with us now. I&rsquo;m sorry, lads,
that I drew you into this trap.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it, Paul,&rdquo; I replied, trying to
shake off a sense of impending doom. &ldquo;We got
along famously under your leadership until just
now, and what has happened is in no way your
fault. Let&rsquo;s brace up, all of us, and take things
as they come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; remarked Joe, in his slow way.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in places nearly as desperate as this
before, and managed to wiggle out alive. We
seem to be beaten, at present, but it&rsquo;s a good omen
that these people didn&rsquo;t kill us while we lay unconscious
and at their mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; nodded Ned Britton. &ldquo;While
there&rsquo;s life, there&rsquo;s hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t show the white feather, anyhow,&rdquo;
said Archie. &ldquo;If it comes to dying, as it may,
we&rsquo;ll die game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pedro gave a sob and drew his hand across his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo; mine me,&rdquo; he said, apologetically. &ldquo;If
Pedro mus&rsquo; die, he die like a game, too&mdash;a much
small game. But Pedro no like to die. It hurt
so bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it does,&rdquo; laughed Archie. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re none
of us hankering for it, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nux and Bryonia were seemingly unmoved.
They were accustomed to accepting the inevitable
with philosophy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bad t&rsquo;ing, Mars&rsquo; Sam,&rdquo; was all Nux said; and
Bry shook his head and remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to have one big fight to end it. If big
fight come, Bry don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chaka was silent and reserved. After clasping
his Brother Paul&rsquo;s hand a moment he relapsed
into a state of dignified unconcern. He reminded
me of the Mussleman who is content with this
life but is willing to die because he believes the
next life better.</p>
<p>Before long the officer returned, with his attendant
and the robes. We had braced up now and
showed neither anger at what had occurred nor
fear at our helpless condition. On his part the
young fellow made no reference to his easy victory
over us. He quietly passed around the robes and
sandals, waited until we had put them on and
then said, somewhat more respectfully than before:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will now accompany me to the Tribunal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>With this he turned to leave the room. We
followed in double file, Chaka and Paul first, then
Joe and I, Archie and Ned, Nux and Bryonia and
Pedro at the end. We assumed a demeanor of
proud indifference which I assure you we were
far from feeling.</p>
<p>Down the corridor, along the big hall and
through the door we marched, and not a soldier
appeared to guard us. It was not necessary.</p>
<p>Now we had our first daylight view of the
magnificent valley and the city of Tcha.</p>
<p>From the level where we stood the mountain
sides rose almost perpendicularly to a height of
two hundred feet or more; not in smooth cliffs,
but rugged, irregular and picturesque. At the
base of these sides had been built the largest and
most important of the palaces and dwellings; but
these were all at the south end of the oval valley.
The north end was fitted with huge buildings more
substantial than ornate, and here we afterward
learned were located the manufactories and warehouses.
A broad boulevard ran before this unbroken
circle of buildings, and it was bordered by
parkings of close cropped grass, drinking fountains
and broad-spreading palms. Then came a
circle of less imposing dwellings, in two rows,
one facing the first or Great Boulevard, the other
row facing the valley on a second boulevard, this
of course being of less extent, as it formed the
inner circle. The same arrangement was repeated
five times, thus carrying the city proper in a vast
belt around the outer edge of the valley.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>All of the central space was devoted to agriculture,
and except for a few public buildings only
granaries and storehouses were built there. Yet
it was all as elaborately laid out as a public park,
and the soil must have been wonderfully fertile.</p>
<p>One or two natural brooks that flowed through
the place fed several canals used for irrigation
and boating; and although the Vale of Tcha was
really extensive, without an inch of waste space,
it was so hemmed in by the mountain that it looked
like a toy kingdom.</p>
<p>Escorted by the officer we traversed paths bordered
with gay flowers which led through the
pasture lands and grain fields, making indirectly
toward a large enclosure near the north end of
the valley. I could not imagine what this place
was, at first, but saw many white-robed figures
flocking to it from various parts of the town.
When we drew nearer it resolved itself into a great
outdoor hall, built much like the ancient Greek
theatres, although it was probably much older
than the Greek nation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>All unguarded we followed our conductor to
the entrance of this theatre. There was no possible
chance to escape. While we were in the Vale
of Tcha and unarmed we were virtually in a
prison, with ten thousand native inhabitants for
jailors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE ARE CONDEMNED BY THE TRIBUNAL</span></h2>
<p>The theatre, or rather assembly hall, was built
so that a small stage or platform faced row after
row of circular marble seats which rose in tiers,
one slightly elevated above another, until the highest
tier was some sixty feet above the ground.
As we were led in I noticed that the seats were
nearly filled with men, women and children. All
wore the staple white toga, often over finer garments
which fitted the body loosely and were more
or less embroidered and decorated according to
the fancy or the station of the wearer. Sometimes
these togas were solid white throughout, but more
usually there was a plain or figured band of a
different color around the hem and the neck. The
women affected wider borders and more color on
their garments than the men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>Every inhabitant of Tcha, male or female, had
red hair. There were many shades from deep
auburn to brick red; but it was all undeniably red.
Eyes, too, were invariably blue, being likewise of
many graduations of shade, from dark violet to
light watery azure. The complexions of the people,
as I have said, were dazzingly fair, with few
freckles, and this despite the warm latitude in
which they lived. However, I never knew it uncomfortably
warm in Tcha.</p>
<p>Having remarked upon the fine physique of
the men of Tcha, I may as well state here that
their women were the handsomest females I have
ever seen. It would not have been possible to find
an unattractive maid or matron in the hidden city.
They were, as a rule, tall and slight, exceedingly
graceful and free of carriage and of extraordinary
facial beauty. Cheery and bright they seemed
but neither talkative nor frivolous. Modest and
unassuming at all times they yet maintained an
air of stately pride that won and retained the respect
and deference of the opposite sex. In Tcha
the women were considered the equal of men in
all ways, and their superiors in many.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>A more reserved and unexcitable race has never
existed. In the assemblage we faced there was
no disorder of any sort. Even the children restrained
any evidence of feeling. Inimical, powerfully
opposed to the strangers who had intruded
upon them we felt them to be; yet no jeers nor
insults came from the throng, which represented
the rank and file of the populace.</p>
<p>The officer lined us up facing the low platform,
upon which sat a group of three aged men. Their
beards&mdash;many wore beards in this valley&mdash;were
snow white, and their heads were bald. They
were not wrinkled nor decrepit, but carried themselves
erect and proudly.</p>
<p>Of course I knew this was the powerful Tribunal
which was to decide our fate, and so I examined
their faces with interest. Their eyes,
which returned our gaze, were mild and calm in
expression. There was no sign of hatred, antagonism
or cruelty in those placid countenances.
Somehow I took heart as I read the faces of the
Tribune, and felt relieved that we had been
brought before them for judgment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>All others in that vast throng were commoners:
the three aged members of the Tribunal alone
possessed authority. We knew nothing as yet
of the political constitution of the people, but this
conclusion was self evident.</p>
<p>The officer knelt and removed his casque.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Fathers, are the strangers,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>One of the three addressed us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who speaks for you, strangers?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>Allerton stepped forward and bowed respectfully.
The three aged heads bent to acknowledge
the salutation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;We desire to question
you, sir, and trust you will answer us truly.
Why are you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came,&rdquo; said Paul, using the expressive
Maya language, which seemed to be spoken in
the valley, &ldquo;merely from curiosity. We are experienced
travelers, from a country afar off, and
we wished to see your valley, to meet your people
and to make you our friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The third Tribune spoke. &ldquo;How came you to
know that the Vale of Tcha exists?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Allerton hesitated, not knowing how to answer.
He tried to choose his words with great
care, for words meant lives at this crisis.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>There was no impatience displayed by the
Tribune, yet our leader&rsquo;s very hesitation was
against us. It was a fair question, from their
standpoint, but the most difficult one Paul could
have been called upon to answer. He must at all
hazards protect his friend and &ldquo;brother&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But Chaka showed his mettle then. He advanced
a pace and standing beside Allerton he
said in a clear voice that could be heard by all:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was I who told him of the hidden Vale of
Tcha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three graybeards examined the speaker
carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an Itzaex,&rdquo; said one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Chaka Atkayma, the child of the gods
and the hereditary ruler of my people,&rdquo; was the
proud assertion. Chaka was superb when he
assumed this mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how came you to know of the Vale of
Tcha?&rdquo; was the next question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father, the great Tcheltzada Atkayma,
told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The members of the Tribunal exchanged glances
of intelligence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did he ask you to keep the information secret,
to use it only to prevent your people from coming
too near to the mountain of Aota?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; said Chaka. &ldquo;But I related the story
to my brother Paul, whom I love as myself. When
he became eager to visit your city I offered to
guide him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The graybeards nodded. They felt they were
now getting the plain, unvarnished truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you not realize the penalty of your act;
the fate sure to overtake you if you succeeded in
coming among the people of Tcha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allerton had recovered his wits by now, and
strove to shield his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did, your Highness, and warned my comrades
and me. But we paid little heed to his protests.
Why should we be unwelcome in Tcha?
We come not as enemies but as friends. We are
few in numbers; the Tcha are thousands. In no
other country of the great wide world are peaceful
strangers forbidden the hospitality of the
people.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>I thought this was a hard hit, and a corking
good argument; but the three bald heads did not
seem impressed by it. One of them replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Tcha have the right to make their own
laws, and to protect themselves from intrusion.
For thousands of years we have been sufficient to
ourselves, ignoring the outer world from whence
you came. We have forbidden strangers to
come among us. Through the Tcheltzada Atkayma
of the Itzaex we warned all men to keep
away from our domain, under penalty of death.
You have disregarded our warning; you have
disobeyed our laws. Therefore you must submit
to the punishment your folly has brought upon
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pleasant prospect, wasn&rsquo;t it? Chaka said, in
a firm voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I alone, your Highness, deserve punishment.
It was my disobedience of your commands that
permitted these people to come to the Vale of
Tcha. I claim at your hands full punishment for
my fault, and the release of my innocent friends.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so!&rdquo; cried Allerton, quickly. &ldquo;It was I
who, learning of your hidden city, persuaded
Chaka Atkayma to guide me here. It was I who
induced these comrades to accompany us. The
fault is mine, your Highness. I alone deserve the
death penalty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an impressive moment the three members
of the aged Tribunal gazed full into the faces of
these strange contestants for the honor of death.
Then they deliberately rose, walked around the
bench where they had been seated and sat down
in a row with their backs toward us and the
assemblage.</p>
<p>At this every head in the audience was bowed
low, as if in prayer. Absolute silence reigned.
Not even the rustle of a garment was to be heard.</p>
<p>The Tribunal was deciding our fate.</p>
<p>I own that I felt desperately uneasy and weak-kneed.
The gentleness of demeanor of the old
men and the quiet repression of the populace
should have been reassuring; but somehow the
chills would run up and down my back in spite
of me. Chaka and Paul turned and embraced
one another with mutual love and gratitude, after
which they stood proudly erect and awaited their
fate. As for the rest of us, fearful as we were we
failed to show the white feather. Cowardice at
such a time would be strangely out of place; because,
perhaps, it was so unavailing. Unless it
may prove profitable, cowardice is the rankest
folly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>After a brief consultation the members of the
Tribune came back to their first position, facing
us. Their gaze was as calm and inscrutable as
before. Then one of them rose to his feet and
addressed the assemblage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The strangers are all condemned to death,&rdquo;
said he, quietly. &ldquo;The laws of our fathers, the
founders of the Vale and City of Tcha, must be
obeyed. Once we pardoned an atkayma of the
Itzaex and sent him back to his people, that
through fear and in self-protection he might preserve
us from further molestation or intrusion.
That was deemed a wise action at the time, but
it is not necessary for us to spare the atkayma&rsquo;s
son, who stands before us. For, thinking the
young man had perished, Tcheltzada confided our
secret to his brother Datchapa, an old and wise
Itzaex who will now rule his people and is too
cautions to disobey our commands.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>I wondered how he knew all this, and if old
Datchapa had really survived his tumble down
the side of the pyramid. When the speaker sat
down another Tribune rose, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As our laws provide, in such cases, the civil
government of Tcha, which we the Tribune represents,
is powerless to do more than condemn
strangers who intrude upon our domain. The
prisoners must now be turned over to her Supreme
Highness the High Priestess of the Sun,&rdquo; (here
Tribunal and people all bowed their heads
humbly) &ldquo;that they may be used for the sacrifice,
if found fit, or otherwise destroyed. This is our
decree, the decree of the Tribunal of Tcha, from
which there is no appeal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the third judge arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prisoners must be taken to the Holy
Temple at once and delivered to the representatives
of her Supreme Highness, the hereditary
High Priestess of the Sun. And may the god
approve us and shed his blessings upon us, now
as heretofore.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE ARGUE WITH THE HIGH PRIESTESS</span></h2>
<p>Well, it was all over, and we had no chance to
demur or make any protest. The members of
the Tribune gathered their robes about them and
walked away, and then the tiers of seats began
to empty, without haste and in an orderly, circumspect
manner.</p>
<p>Curious looks were cast at us, but I could read
neither pity nor abhorrence in any countenance.
We were wholly outside the lives of this strange
race, and they accepted our fate as a matter of
course.</p>
<p>The officer who had brought us here now
turned and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been tried and judged, strangers.
You have heard the verdict of the just Tribunal.
Follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>Of course we tagged along after him; there
was nothing else to be done. We now headed
straight for the city, and that especial part of it
situated at the south end of the valley. The
people, returning to their dwellings, avoided interfering
with us. While within earshot they did
not discuss us or our unhappy destiny. Through
centuries they have been taught consideration for
others, nor did they forget the lesson even in their
conduct toward strangers and condemned criminals.</p>
<p>Our glimpses of the residences we passed filled
us with wonder and admiration. Highly polished
marble, ornate and artistic carvings, exquisite
tropical shrubbery, closely mowed lawns, fountains,
cornices and ornaments of wrought gold
were everywhere visible. The approaches to
some of the finer dwellings were paved with layers
of golden sheets, riveted together and in some
instances bordered with fine rubies and other gems.
Gold seemed the most abundant metal the Tcha
possessed, and they had a secret way of hardening
it that rendered it as durable as steel, without
impairing its beauty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>Approaching nearer and nearer to the south
wall of the mountain enclosing the valley, we at
last reached the most impressive and extensive
building of all&mdash;the Temple of the Sun. Ample
grounds surrounded the huge, majestic pile, enclosed
by marble walls ten feet in height, which
were supplemented by a six-foot ornamental railing
of elaborately worked gold. The entrance
gates were likewise of gold, and bore in the center
of each a highly polished representation of the
sun shedding its rays in every direction.</p>
<p>News of our coming had evidently preceded
us, for the great gates at once swung inward to
receive us and a group of tall priests, most of them
advanced in years, stood ready to admit the devoted
band of prisoners to the sacred precincts.
The official did not pass the gates. He reverently
removed his casque and said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;Holy fathers, to your keeping I confide the
condemned. They now belong to our mother, the
divine and adorable High Priestess of our god,
the Sun.&rdquo; Then, turning to us he continued in
an earnest tone: &ldquo;Destiny directs all human life.
You are brave men, strangers, and are prepared
to well fulfill the decree of Destiny. Being on
the threshold of the great Hereafter, I give you
greetings and good wishes. May your journey
be peaceful and swift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without awaiting our thanks for this doleful
farewell he turned and departed, while with small
ado we were marched through the gates and allowed
to hear them swing shut behind us, the
ring of their golden bars sounding like a knell in
my ears. According to the best calculations of
the Tcha we were never to pass this barrier again,
either alive or dead.</p>
<p>Directly facing the gates was the great temple,
entered by a broad flight of steps and composed
of four walls, roofless and open to the rays of the
Sun. Entirely separated from this main building
were two others of smaller dimensions but much
more elaborate. That at the right had a separate
enclosure and was connected with the temple by
a peristyle; the other, toward which we were
directed, stood alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>This, we found, was the palace of the High
Priest and the residence of the numerous priests
of the sun. The leaders of the reception committee
were diverse. One was a wild-eyed, ascetic
looking fellow who glared at us but kept silent;
the other proved a kindly-faced man who treated
us with marked respect.</p>
<p>After giving us a cool and refreshing beverage
to drink&mdash;it reminded me of lemonade&mdash;we were
taken to the presence of the High Priest, a doddering,
withered old individual who seemed to
have lived far beyond his allotted time and was
drowsing contentedly when we disturbed him.
He woke up to stare at us a moment, then waved
us away, saying to our escort:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They belong to the great god, the Sun.
Cherish them; treat them tenderly, as befits those
to be prepared for the sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the moment we were inclined to resent this.
None of us, I am sure, had any desire to become
a sacrificial offering. But as we left the High
Priest, who had fallen asleep again even before
he had finished speaking, Chaka congratulated us
on our good fortune.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;Had we been deemed unworthy of their great
god,&rdquo; he explained in English, &ldquo;they would have
killed us at sundown to-night, murdering us in
cold blood and tossing our carcasses to the beasts.
Sacrificial offerings are reserved for special occasions
and are often prepared for weeks in advance,
being cherished and fattened that they may
become the more acceptable to the god. Therefore
this order means we shall gain time to plan
an escape. That may not be impossible, my
friends, after all; and, in any event, time has its
value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterward the atkayma told us that had not
the High Priest been in his dotage he assuredly
would not have accepted our blacks for sacrifice.
The Mexican might pass, perhaps, as his skin
was not unlike the color of that of the Itzaex; but
the Sun-god might not like black sacrifices. The
event, however, proved that Chaka was wrong
in this conclusion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>We were now treated with great respect by the
priests, even the wild-eyed one being willing to
&ldquo;cherish&rdquo; the victims. Having been formally
dedicated to their god our persons were sacred
and our comfort and welfare the objects of much
solicitude. If one of us expressed a desire it was
at once granted, and we were surrounded by every
luxury the luxurious palace afforded. In effect
we became autocrats, commanding the priests at
will. One thing only was denied us&mdash;permission
to leave the temple enclosure.</p>
<p>For four dreary days we lived this sybaritic
life; they were dreary because we had little to
do but to eat and sleep and take life easy. Of
course we talked over our delicate position and
sought to evolve some plan of escape, but without
the precious outfit that had been taken from
us we were practically helpless.</p>
<p>All the Vale of Tcha was under the supreme
rule of the High Priestess of the Sun, an hereditary
title that had been handed down from mother
to daughter for thousands of years&mdash;how many
thousands we as yet were unable to learn. The
High Priestess was attended by fifty Virgins between
the ages of fifteen and thirty. Having
served to the latter age they were released, sent
back to their homes and permitted to marry. The
daughters of these original Virgins of the Sun
were entitled to succeed their mothers, in time;
if there were not enough of them choice was
made of young girls from the noblest families of
the nation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>Next in rank came the High Priest, who was
supported by fifty priests. These last, however,
held their positions for life, and their ranks were
filled from time to time by the most intelligent
and deserving of the young men of Tcha. But
so arduous were the duties of the priesthood that
there was no time to fuss over civil affairs and
the administration of the laws; so a Tribunal was
selected by the High Priestess, the members of
which served during their natural lives, directing
all the minor affairs of the nation.</p>
<p>The Tcha believed but in one god, the Sun,
from whence they considered they derived all the
good things of life. They were communists to
an extent, although divided into castes. The
manufacturers&rsquo; guild was the most important of
all, after the priesthood and the nobility, the latter being
a luxurious class consisting of relatives
of the priestesses and their subsequent children,
but who constituted the scientific and literary class
as well. The manufacturers&rsquo; guild included goldsmiths,
weavers, millers and bakers, and all those
who produced goods or wares from raw material.
Next came the agriculturists, then the miners, and
finally the builders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>Every inhabitant of the Vale of Tcha belonged
to one or another of them castes and was supposed
to keep busy, a drone being despised by all.
Everything produced went into the public warehouses
and from there was distributed to each
family according to its requirements.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the fourth day of our imprisonment
a message came to us that the High
Priestess desired to see the &ldquo;sacrificial devotees.&rdquo;
The priests at once bustled about and brought
us fresh togas and our white duck suits, which
we wore under the robes. We were washed and
brushed like schoolboys and given endless advice
as to our conduct in the presence of &ldquo;the Divine
and Supreme Ama&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ama&rdquo; meant in the Maya tongue &ldquo;mother&rdquo;.
If the High Priestess had any other name we
never heard it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>When we had been properly fixed up and inspected
by the wild-eyed one, who had authority
under the senile High Priest, we were ushered
past the great temple to the gates of the enclosure
beyond. Here the priests turned us over to the
care of six beautiful damsels whose tunics bore
the device of the flaming sun. They were in no
way embarrassed by the care of nine men of a
strange race. Indeed, they regarded us impersonally
as sacrifices intended in the near future
to propitiate their god.</p>
<p>Demurely they led us along flower-bordered
walks; into the main entrance of the magnificent
palace of the Priestesses, through a lofty hall and
out by a rear entrance, down a long pergola shaded
by climbing roses, past a garden resplendent with
rare and gorgeous blooms, and finally into a roomy
pavilion that stood almost at the edge of the cliff
that towered above the city.</p>
<p>The pillars, roof and floor of the pavilion were
of pure white marble. In the center was a fountain
that sent its cooling sprays far into the air.
Beyond the fountain we found the floor strewn
with exquisite rugs and downy cushions while
in the rear of this spacious retreat was a golden
divan upon which reclined the High Priestess,
Supreme Ruler of the Vale of Tcha.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>How shall I describe Ama to you? Shall I say
she was the embodiment of grace and beauty, that
her figure was tall and supple, her hair a golden
bronze, her eyes turquoise and her lips budded
like a rose? All that seems stale and flat in depicting
Ama.</p>
<p>To our amazement this redoubtable High
Priestess, in whose hands reposed all power, was
a mere child, scarcely more than seventeen years
of age.</p>
<p>No daintier, fairer, sweeter girl could be imagined.
Reared from the cradle to occupy this exalted
position, she was a real queen, regal alike in
bearing, in natural attributes, in education and
in person. Never had she known a wish unfulfilled,
never a command thwarted. She had succeeded
her mother at twelve years of age, and her
omnipotence among the Tcha was accepted by the
girl without a thought that she owed all to the
accident of birth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>As we stood before her the mighty priestess
sat up and examined us with undisguised interest.
First she deliberately stared at Paul, until
his eyes fell and a deep blush suffused his face.
Then Chaka was observed, with evidences of lively
approval. Indeed, the youthful atkayma looked
very handsome in his haughty, dignified pose, and
his brown eyes met those of Ama quite frankly.
When she turned to me I bowed and smiled. She
was only a girl; why should I fear her? Yet for
some reason we had all forgotten entirely our
instructions to prostrate ourselves most humbly
before the Supreme Ruler. We felt more like
treating her as we would an American girl.</p>
<p>One by one she silently scrutinized us all. Then,
lying back on her cushions, she waved her hands
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be seated, thou consecrated ones, thou who
art sacred to our Lord the Sun. Let us converse
together,&rdquo; she added, graciously.</p>
<p>We squatted on the rugs, arranging ourselves
as comfortably as possible, and the attendant Virgins
followed suit. When we were seated Ama
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you contented? Have you any request
to make?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, your Highness,&rdquo; ventured Paul, earnestly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;Speak, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your god,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is not the God of our
fathers. We do not wish to be sacrificed to a
strange god. Coming as friends and without evil
intent to your country, we have been deprived of
our liberty and consecrated to a god we do not
worship. The action of the Tcha has been unjust
and unkind. We desire to be set free and allowed
to return to our own people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ama seemed disturbed by this statement. She
sat up again, resting an elbow upon her knee and
her chin upon the palm of her hand, listening
carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; she said in reply, &ldquo;your protest comes
all too late. The decree has passed the Tribunal.
The High Priest has accepted you as worthy sacrifices.
Already are you consecrated to the Divine
Sun, whose majesty would be outraged if robbed
of his offerings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t we anything to say about our own
fate?&rdquo; I asked indignantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, indeed!&rdquo; she responded, smiling bewitchingly.
&ldquo;When one breaks the laws of a
country he loses his individual right to direct his
fate. Is it not so in the land from whence you
came?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are outsiders to know your laws, when
you seclude yourselves from all the rest of mankind?&rdquo;
inquired Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we seclude ourselves, it is evidence we do
not desire intrusion,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>We began to admit to ourselves it would not be
easy to influence this fair young girl. She had
been taught to conserve the traditions of her people;
her ethics of law were fairly sound.</p>
<p>For a time she appeared to be absorbed in
thought. Then she said abruptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me of your own country. You differ
from and are superior to others who, at times,
have come here to disturb us. Most of them, I
am told, for it was all before my time, were found
to be unworthy to be dedicated to the sacrifice.
But you, it seems, have learned to fly as the birds
fly, and you bear strange and death-dealing weapons.
You clothe yourselves with many hitherto
unknown devices, and in your chests are many
things the use of which we are ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>This speech gave Allerton an idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The countries of the outside world,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;are of vast extent and throng with millions
of people. These teach to one another the
knowledge they acquire and the scientific discoveries
they make. Therefore they progress
much more rapidly than any secluded people, such
as the Tcha, can hope to do. Forgive me for saying
it, your Highness, but your people are ignorant
of many things. They are far behind other
nations in arts, sciences and inventions, and very
insignificant when compared with the people from
whom we came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;you are way
behind the procession, Ama&mdash;chasing the times,
so to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She listened, and regarded us thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Tcha is the greatest nation in all the
world!&rdquo; she declared, with queenly pride.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is far from that, your Highness,&rdquo; replied
Allerton. &ldquo;If you ventured outside this puny
circle of rocks your nation would soon be swallowed
up by the great world and practically
annihilated. Because we are nine helpless travelers
you seize and destroy us. In the outside world
your entire population would appear meaner and
more helpless than we nine are among you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She suddenly sprang up with flashing eyes and
stamped her foot angrily upon the rug, like a
pettish school-girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you come here and lie to me?&rdquo; she
cried with spirit. &ldquo;How dare you malign my
people, the mighty Tcha, to their Supreme Ruler,
the Priestess of the Sun? Begone, outcasts that
you are! begone and leave me to forget the shame
you have thrust upon me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went away, of course. There wasn&rsquo;t time
to argue the proposition, and I feared Paul had
made a sad mistake. Archie was sorry, too, for I
had noticed he was holding the hand of a pretty
priestess who sat next him.</p>
<p>But there was a satisfied look on Allerton&rsquo;s
face, and as the Virgins thrust us out of their
enclosure into the arms of the priests awaiting
us he said in English:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;That shot told, all right, and soon she will
want to know more about the outside world.
Don&rsquo;t be despondent, boys; I&rsquo;ve an idea we may
win out yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE SAVE A VALUABLE LIFE</span></h2>
<p>That Paul was correct in his conclusion was
proven the very next day. Again the High Priestess
sent for us, but asked that the blacks, Ned
and Pedro be left behind. We objected to this,
declaring we must all come, or none at all, and to
our surprise she withdrew her exceptions and
commanded us all to attend her.</p>
<p>This time she received us in the open air, in a
large area directly beneath the overhanging cliff,
which was covered with a network of climbing
vines to relieve its ruggedness and hide the protruding
points of rock. It was almost a perpendicular
wall, at this place, and I saw the mouth
of a cavern that has a well worn path leading
into it. Doubtless the mountain was honeycombed
with caves and recesses, some being
natural and many others artificial.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>Close to the cliff stood a throne-like seat cut
from a solid block of rock. It was well lined with
cushions, however, amongst which sat the girlish
High Priestess, even more charming and lovely
than when we had first seen her. The ground
before the throne was strewn with rugs, upon
which sat not only many of the Virgins of the
Sun, but a large gathering of the people of Tcha,
evidently culled from the most cultured and important
among them. I recognized the three aged
members of the Tribunal, who occupied a position
near the Priestess, and the doddering old
High Priest, who had already fallen asleep among
his cushions. But no one, however important,
was allowed a raised seat in the presence of the
Supreme Ruler of Tcha.</p>
<p>One of the girls who acted as Master of Ceremonies
assigned us our places. Chaka was led
to the right of the throne; Paul was placed somewhat
to the left. Joe, Archie and I were seated
about midway in the audience, while the others
of our party were consigned to the very rear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>I understood readily enough the meaning of
this assemblage. Ama was going to make Paul
prove his statement that the Tcha was a mean
and insignificant race, and she had invited her
most prominent people to support her in the argument.</p>
<p>So it proved. With much dignity but in simple
words she repeated the assertion made to her the
day before. Then she turned to Paul and regarding
him with steady eyes she asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nation, in the world you know so well,
is more ancient than that of the Tcha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled, bowing low before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know how old the Tcha may be,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>She motioned to an important looking fellow
who rose and answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Tcha nation has existed seven thousand,
four hundred and nineteen years, each year being
composed of three hundred and sixty five days.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Allerton, readily, &ldquo;I am sure you
lead all nations in point of age. But have you
existed in this mountain hollow all that time?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. Our race came from Atlantis four thousand
and eighty-five years ago, and established
itself here and at the north. The cities erected
elsewhere were in time all destroyed. Only this
branch of the Tcha, owing to our methods of
seclusion and our wise laws, exists to this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allerton bowed in acknowledgment and turned
to Ama again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has any other race you know been able to
harness the electric currents of nature, and make
them furnish power and light?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These things are common throughout the
world,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>The Tcha exchanged looks of wonderment, and
some shook their heads doubtingly. Finally one
arose and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The records which we have preserved show
that when we brought our knowledge of electricity
from Atlantis, the savage inhabitants of this
continent were wholly ignorant of it. They had
even no chariots to run by electricity. The records
prove this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; spoke Paul, &ldquo;you are entitled to precedence
in this matter, as well. Such things the
world is well acquainted with to-day, and we have
many uses for electricity which you, perhaps, have
never yet dreamed of; but they have all been discovered
within the last fifty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This admission seemed to please the Tcha.
Ama, who took a deep interest in the discussion,
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, then; what electric devices are in use
by your people that we know not of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By means of a wire,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I, at one
end of this valley, can talk with a person at the
other end, who will hear me distinctly, although
I do not raise my voice. Again, I can point a
tube at one standing a hundred paces away, and
render him as one dead; yet he will recover in
a short space of time. Still again, I am able to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sprang to my feet, crying aloud in fear and
horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; and pointed upward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>For, gazing casually at the cliff overhead, I
had seen a large rock slowly detach itself from
the wall and hang trembling just above Ama&rsquo;s
throne, as it held in place only by the clinging
vines above it.</p>
<p>Many an eye followed my direction and although
I had spoken in English they all understood
the terrible danger that threatened their
Priestess. Yet not a soul moved; abject horror
seemed to have paralyzed them. Ama alone was
unconscious of her impending death and stared
wonderingly at the startled faces before her.</p>
<p>Suddenly Paul gave a leap and bounded
straight for the throne. Swift as an arrow he
flew and caught the girl in his arms. At the same
time the huge rock broke away and came hurtling
to the ground. Paul saw it, and, acting instinctively,
exerted all his strength and threw the girl
bodily from him. Chaka, rushing forward,
caught her just as the crash came and the great
mass&mdash;I think it must have weighed two tons&mdash;fell
full upon the throne of the High Priestess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>Trying to stifle the sob that rose in my throat
I dashed to the spot, knowing that my dear friend&mdash;I
had come to be very fond of Allerton&mdash;was
buried beneath that massive fragment. His had
been a noble deed, I fully realized, but it seemed
so hard to have him crushed and mangled, to
have him swept suddenly from life, for the sake
of a paltry Tcha girl, Supreme Ruler though she
might be.</p>
<p>The people had awakened now and were clustering
anxiously around their Priestess, who lay
half fainting in Chaka&rsquo;s arms. The young
atkayma did not look at her; he stared straight
ahead at the spot where his &ldquo;brother Paul&rdquo; lay
buried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Lend a hand!&rdquo; I shouted, first in English
and then in Maya. Nux and Bryonia, Ned,
Pedro, Archie and Joe were all with me by that
time. The great rock had split half over the
throne, and one fragment&mdash;that which lay above
Paul&mdash;rested with its edge partly supported by
the arm of the seat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>We seized it and pulled all together, trying to
pry it upward. Several of the Tchas now came
to our assistance, and in desperation we tugged
again, this time succeeding in forcing the fragment
backward. Then Joe stooped down and
drew Paul out, handing his bruised and bleeding
form to Nux, who held it tenderly in his strong
arms as a mother might cuddle a child.</p>
<p>Chaka, having resigned his burden, came to us
with features drawn and tense with agony. The
poor fellow did not sob nor weep; he merely
leaned over and kissed his friend&rsquo;s forehead.
Then without awaiting permission we all retired,
following Nux and his burden back to our luxurious
rooms in the priests&rsquo; palace.</p>
<p>We laid Allerton tenderly on a couch and cut
away his clothing. Bry was a very expert surgeon,
of the uneducated but intelligent sort, having
had a lot of practical experience with wounds
and bruises in his day. He now assumed command
of the situation.</p>
<p>With his ear to the injured man&rsquo;s heart the
black gave a grunt of satisfaction and then turned
to take the water I had brought in a basin to wash
away the blood stains.</p>
<p>My own heart was thumping like a trip hammer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he live, Bry?&rdquo; I asked, breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say Mars&rsquo; Sam,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But
he&rsquo;s alive now, shore &rsquo;nuf!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE FIND THE TCHA GRATEFUL</span></h2>
<p>Allerton said that he seemed to live an hour
during the time the rock was falling. He saw
plainly that he could not save both himself and
Ama, so he threw the girl to Chaka and at the
same time tripped and fell to the ground just beside
the throne. That trip alone saved him, as
the fragment that broke from the main portion
struck in such a way that a small space was left,
in which his body lay. He was considerably
bruised and cut, but with the exception of two
broken ribs and a sprained arm escaped any other
important injury. We had him sitting up in an
hour, and under Bry&rsquo;s skillful manipulation, assisted
by a Tcha priest who was fairly proficient
in surgery, his broken ribs quickly mended. But
the shock to his nervous system had been severe
and Paul became an interesting invalid for several
days after the accident.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>Being an ancient people, the Tcha have a code
of laws that seems to cover every possible happening;
but some of them, perhaps evolved centuries
ago, are quite extraordinary. One law declares
that if any person performs an exceptional
service for the High Priestess, such as &ldquo;preserving
her life or preventing her from suffering
physical injury,&rdquo; he shall become immune from
any punishment he may have incurred by any
previous act, and all edicts against him shall be
annulled.</p>
<p>The Tribunal was aware of this law and
promptly acted upon it; but the august body,
during its conference, encountered a puzzling and
unexampled difficulty. Who had saved the life
of the High Priestess? Either it was Paul, who
had removed Ama from beneath the falling stone,
or Chaka, who had caught her and carried her
to a safe distance, or myself, whose cry had called
attention to her danger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>To my mind Paul alone had accomplished the
salvation of the Supreme Ruler; but the aged
Tribunal could not see it exactly in that light.
They argued the case among themselves until
they were in despair of being able to settle it conclusively.
One voted for me, one for Chaka and
one for Paul, and being very conscientious and
eminently just none would alter his decision. So
the matter was laid before the High Priest, as
provided for by law when the Tribunal could not
agree. As usual the old sleepyhead revoked; he
said he didn&rsquo;t know and didn&rsquo;t care who had
saved Ama; it was sufficient for him that she
had been saved; let the High Priestess herself
solve the knotty problem. And then he fell asleep
again.</p>
<p>Therefore the case came to Ama herself for
solution, and she appeared as perplexed as the
others. Finally she took it under advisement and
said she would come to a decision some day in
the near future.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>I am sure the incident considerably improved
our standing in the community. It must have
humiliated the Tcha, who are really brave and
energetic, that they all sat in paralyzed terror
while the condemned strangers saved their High
Priestess from sudden death. A careful investigation
was now made of the cliff to see if any
more stones were loose, on the principle of locking
the barn door after the horse is stolen; but
no one was ever accused of negligence for not
having inspected the cliff before. Occasionally
a rock had been known to drop into the valley,
but it was a rare occurrence and seldom did much
harm. The Tcha considered this accident a mere
fatality, and therefore unavoidable.</p>
<p>The sensations of the lovely and sedate Ama
when seized and hurled about like a ball were
not subject to popular discussion. For a day or
two following we heard indirectly that the girl
was nervous and unstrung, as well she might be;
but on the third day she sent for Paul, Chaka
and me, and thanked us all very prettily and impartially.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>The public argument over the merits and discoveries
of our respective civilizations was now
abandoned for good. But Ama had us frequently
brought to her pavilion, where she questioned us
closely and seemed greatly interested in our personal
history and home life. All subjects interested
her: politics, geography and inventions most
of all. On one occasion Paul asked for our
chests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we had them here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I could furnish
you and your attendants with much amusement,
and prove to you many things that are
difficult to explain in words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She considered this request, and when we were
next called to an interview with her Highness
we found the four chests standing in a row before
her couch. They had all been broken open
and the contents rummaged, but not a single article
had been removed or injured in any way&mdash;except
that the extra gas-jacket and inflatable
coverings for the chests had been abstracted. Our
electrites, the use of which they shrewdly suspected,
and all of our gas-jackets and firearms
were withheld from us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>Paul first unrolled our maps and showed Ama
the great world, with its lakes, seas and oceans
and chains of lofty mountains. He showed her
on a smaller map the location of Yucatan, and
how insignificant the peninsula was when compared
with the great continent of which it formed
a part. Then with a pencil he made a tiny dot
to show the location of Mount Aota and its comparative
size.</p>
<p>Ama observed all this with pensive earnestness.
She made no remarks nor admissions, but
was evidently impressed. The poor girl had been
trained to consider herself the head of a mighty
nation which was so important that it haughtily
excluded the rest of creation from vulgar contact
with it. She had considered the Tcha of superior
intellect, far in advance of any other race, and
the chosen people of the one great and true god&mdash;the
Sun.</p>
<p>In this belief she and her preceptors were to
an extent justified. Their tiny kingdom lay in
the heart of the Itzaex territory, and the savage
nations surrounding them were in every respect
inferior to the Tcha. They also served as a shield
against the nations beyond, and this fact deceived
the Tcha, who naturally judged all foreign people
by those about them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>Their literature was rich in legendary lore, but
of their contemporaries they were wholly ignorant.
They kept a record of their own history,
using great books made of a fibre parchment,
the leaves being sometimes three feet square and
bound at the edges. They used both hieroglyphics
and picture writing, and what I saw was
quite artistically executed. One great building
was used as a library for these books and contained
records dating from the time of their
emigration from Atlantis, whence they had
been driven by political wars. The Tcha were
merely a branch of the horde that settled in
Yucatan. Their leader was a powerful and able
Priestess who, discovering the fertile vale within
the mountain of Aota&mdash;doubtless in bygone ages
the mouth of a volcano&mdash;decided to settle therein
with her especial followers. In some way the
Tcha escaped the destruction that overwhelmed
the other cities of Yucatan, and their prosperity
continued undiminished through all the centuries.
They knew when Atlantis was submerged, and
by means of a system of spies kept touch with
the doings of the Maya tribes that afterward
settled in the peninsula. The coming of the
Spaniards was a danger recorded in their books,
but they had persuaded the Itzaex to stand firm
and oppose the invaders, and through their assistance
that tribe was never conquered or their
territory overrun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>It surprised me that a people so shrewd in
other ways had never sent spies or emissaries
to the modern nations throughout the world; but
the fact was that they had not the faintest conception
that our great civilization existed. They
alone, in their ignorant belief, were progressive
and cultured.</p>
<p>Our advent was destined to undeceive them in
this respect.</p>
<p>Having shown Ama how small was her valley
Allerton proceeded to prove our superior inventive
genius. He exhibited to the wondering eyes
of Ama and her pretty priestesses some of the
novelties we had brought with us for this very
purpose, and for trading. There was a small
phonograph for one thing, with an assortment
of vocal and instrumental records, and when
these were played they created a veritable sensation.
Paul promptly presented the outfit to the
High Priestess, and it afforded her great pleasure.
The Tcha were a music-loving people, but
their musical instruments were quite primitive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>Next we stretched a copper wire from the
palace of the priests to Ama&rsquo;s pavilion, and set
up a telephone at each end. This aroused no end
of excitement and all the priests and priestesses
soon learned how to use it. Ama called us up
every morning, and she used the wire to convey
her orders to the priests, instead of communicating
with them by messenger, as before.</p>
<p>A pocket electric flash-light excited considerable
admiration, as did some clocks and watches.
The Tcha still used sundials to mark the time.
Some tiny music-boxes, playing one tune, were
presented by us to various officials and the gifts
won us much favor.</p>
<p>We exhibited all these things with careful deliberation,
making them serve as vehicles for many
interviews with the lovely priestess. In return
she graciously showed us some of the accomplishments
of the Tcha.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>We were taken to a vast cave where a large
volume of water gushed from the rocks with
irresistible force. Some inventive Tcha had long
ago constructed an electric motor operated by this
water power, and it supplied electric lights to all
the valley. They did not turn off their lamps,
but allowed them to burn until the filament
burned out, masking them with shields when the
lumination was not required. Archie showed
them how to make a cut-off, and also improved
the shape of their lamps. So receptive and skillful
were the native glass-blowers and artisans generally
that they soon reconstructed their entire
plant on modern principles.</p>
<p>They made a very superior storage battery, by
means of which the chariots of the High Priestess
and her nobility were propelled, in much the same
fashion as our automobiles. They were clumsy
and slow, it is true, but curiously enough this
electrical device, and the others that they used,
dated from the time of their exodus from Atlantis.
The records proved conclusively that electricity
was known and utilized on that lost continent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>The gold which was so plentiful in the valley
was taken from mines in the center of one of the
neighboring mountains, connected with the hidden
city by a broad tunnel. The supply was
practically inexhaustible. Other metals were
found in the walls of Aota, and this accounted
for many of the caverns we noticed.</p>
<p>We learned that the beautiful rubies came from
the subsoil of the valley itself, and the Tcha skillfully
cut and polished them, using them for ornamenting
even the most common articles of use.
When Ama saw that we admired the rubies she
took us to the gem-cutters&rsquo; building and gave us
a pocketful each of choice and brilliant stones&mdash;fully
enough plunder to repay us for our eventful
journey, had we been able to carry it away. But
if we were to be sacrificed to their blood-thirsty
god the Sun, we would never need rubies again.</p>
<p>It was very hard for Ama to decide which of
the strangers was to be preserved from sacrifice
as the reward for saving her life. She seemed to
grow quite fond of Chaka, as the days passed by.
He often sat at her feet telling, like Othello, the
story of his life and adventures, while she listened
with fascinated interest. Moreover, he was
atkayma of the Itzaex, and therefore far outranked
any of the rest of us, who could claim no
such high sounding titles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>Chaka was, as I have remarked, an exceedingly
handsome fellow, and his soft brown eyes grew
expressive whenever he turned them upon the
bewitching priestess. Ama was permitted&mdash;nay,
required&mdash;to marry, and being supreme among
her race could choose her own husband. I sometimes
wondered if it would be the fate of the
young atkayma to become the husband of Ama.</p>
<p>But there was Paul, too, and our friend the
lieutenant had by this time fallen as desperately
in love with the girlish priestess as had Chaka.
While he lacked the personal beauty of the Maya
chieftain Paul was white, and therefore to my
mind a more fitting mate for the beautiful Ama.
He also belonged to the powerful American people
whom the priestess had come by this time to
fully respect, and that was in his favor too.
Really, it was all guesswork as to which admirer
she might prefer, for the girl treated them with
equal frankness and consideration.</p>
<p>Once, when she sat apart with Chaka, I overheard
him urging her to free Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Paul who saved you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;No
other deserves the reward.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>Another time Allerton pleaded for the atkayma,
saying that unless Chaka had caught her as Paul
stumbled she would have been crushed.</p>
<p>I was glad to find myself disregarded in the
matter, since I knew very well my service in crying
a warning was not to be compared with what
they had done. It must have amused Ama to
hear these two brave fellows each plead for the
other, for at last she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must decide it between yourselves, and
I will abide by the decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This mischievous shift accomplished nothing
at all, as the girl plainly foresaw. They argued
with one another until the deadlock became more
set than ever. They proposed to leave it to me
to decide, and I refused to interfere. Neither
would any of our party umpire the case. In
despair they told Ama it was up to her again.</p>
<p>She shook her head and sent for the ancient
High Priest, curtly bidding him keep awake and
attend to what she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot decide which of these three strangers
actually saved me from death,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It is
natural I should be grateful to all three, for which
reason it is unjust to force me to decide the
question. Therefore I command you, by virtue
of your office, to say, and at once, which shall
be pardoned and so saved from the sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think it over,&rdquo; sighed the High Priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; declared Ama,
imperiously. &ldquo;To-morrow some one of these devoted
ones must be selected for the sacrifice of
Adakalpa, the Feast of the Harvest. Gather thy
wits then, my counselor, and speak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I sit down?&rdquo; asked the ancient one,
wearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, for you would then fall asleep. I command
you to decide between these three&mdash;&rdquo; she
pointed to where we were lined up in a row &ldquo;&mdash;at
once. Then you may return to your couch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The High Priest yawned and blinked his
watery eyes at us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon all three,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Each had
a hand in the matter, and it will save us the bother
of choosing between them, perhaps unjustly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ama sat up, laughing. She clapped her hands
delightedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, wise and clever counselor!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;Your decree shall be obeyed. Sleep, now, if it
pleases you, for Chaka, Paul and Samsteele,&rdquo; so
she always called me, rolling my two names into
one, &ldquo;are from this moment free and honored
subjects of Tcha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think the old fellow who had thus favored
us was half asleep before they had led him back
to the gate. As for Paul, Chaka and I, we shook
hands heartily and congratulated one another.
The same idea was uppermost in the minds of all
three&mdash;that our freedom might lead to our being
able to free our comrades.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE LOSE POOR PEDRO</span></h2>
<p>The edict of the High Priest was proclaimed
to the people in the great theatre and received
with the same composure that our condemnation
had been. Thereafter we three wandered at will
throughout the valley, unguarded and unmolested.
We were offered a palace, but retained our quarters
in the house of the priests, to be with our
comrades, and there in secret conference we decided
upon our mode of procedure for the future.</p>
<p>Escape from Tcha by means of the steep walls
of rock was an impossibility, unless we could
stumble upon one of those secret tunnels that led
to the outer declivities. Even then it would be
difficult for us to get the sacrificial victims out
of the temple enclosure. Compassing all this,
however, it was likely we would be followed and
either recaptured or slain before we could reach
the Itzaex country. If not we would be in the
power of either Uncle Datchapa, if he still lived,
or the red robed devils of priests, who would
have no hesitation in promptly murdering us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>No; it would not do at all. We had only one
hope of escape: to recover our gas-jackets and
soar above the valley, over the forests and back
to the ship where my father was by this time
anxiously awaiting us.</p>
<p>So we decided that Paul, Chaka and I, being
free to go and come at our pleasure, must begin a
careful and cautious search for the place where
our confiscated property had been deposited. We
judged this would be one of the warehouses where
public supplies were kept.</p>
<p>Next day we started on our secret mission,
each going a different way. I had been instructed
to seek out the officer who had first arrested us
and robbed us in the prison, and try to pump
him; so after breakfast I sauntered away through
the city, past the theatre and along the flower
bordered paths that led to the low white building
near the center of the valley.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>I met one of the soldiers, or &ldquo;public guardians,&rdquo;
on my way, and found him not loth to enter into
conversation. He told me the officer&rsquo;s name was
Pagatka and his rank that of Waba, or Captain.
He did not know where the Waba Pagatka might
be found; the officer was likely to be anywhere
that duty called him.</p>
<p>When I began cautiously to refer to the property
that had been taken from us the fellow withdrew
into a shell of reserve. He admitted he
had been one of those who had surrounded us
and led us into the prison; but after that he had
returned to his home and knew nothing of subsequent
happenings. I deemed it wise not to press
him or arouse his suspicions as to what I was
after. He parted from me presently and went
his own way.</p>
<p>My search for the Waba Pagatka was unsuccessful.
I entered the great hall of the prison,
where a small guard was stationed, and was allowed
to go anywhere I pleased. All the smaller
rooms but one were unoccupied. Here a man
was confined who had quarreled with his neighbor
and in the heat of argument had used bad
language. He told me he regretted the occurrence,
as it had seriously disgraced him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>There was no place here where our gas-jackets
and electrites were likely to be hidden. The
soldier in charge thought I might find the Waba
in the manufacturing district, so I left the prison
and began my journey toward the upper end of
the valley.</p>
<p>The air was sweet and invigorating, for the
altitude, even here in the cup of the mountain,
was considerable and rendered the climate delightful.
Everywhere the farmers were busy in
their fields, and centuries of cultivation seemed
not to have exhausted the soil in the least. Perhaps
they had learned how to fertilize and restore
it; anyhow, the crops were bountiful and
not a weed nor rank growth of any sort was to
be seen.</p>
<p>At midday I reached a dwelling at the north
edge of the city, and asked for food. It was
willingly furnished and in abundance, for every
inhabitant of Tcha was entitled to his neighbor&rsquo;s
hospitality, all supplies being provided by the
government.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>During the afternoon I wandered about the
district of the artisans trying to catch sight of
the elusive Waba Pagatka, but failing dismally.
I took occasion, however, to look into several
warehouses, and found them all filled with the
handicraft of the people or with raw material to
be worked up. Returning, I circled the city and
passed the weavers&rsquo; dwellings, where I was greatly
interested in the looms these clever people had
invented. They wove the finest linen I have ever
seen, and a material much worn by the women
which seemed to me softer and more exquisitely
finished than the best of our silks. Yet it was
not made from the cocoon of the silk worm, but
from a reed that was shredded into hair-like
filaments. It was really wonderful how great
a variety of things were grown, mined and manufactured
by a few people in a tiny shut-in place
like this.</p>
<p>It was late before I reached the palace of the
priests and I was both hungry and tired by my
day&rsquo;s tramp. Entering the large room reserved
for us I found my comrades sitting with solemn
faces, silent and depressed. Paul and Chaka
were there, so they had evidently been as unsuccessful
as myself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>I glanced around the circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Pedro?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have taken him,&rdquo; said Paul sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I started back in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sacrifice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Allerton. &ldquo;It seems to-day
is the Feast of the Harvest, and when the sun is
highest in the sky&mdash;at midday, that is&mdash;they sacrifice
to their god in gratitude for the ripening
of the grain. Ama spoke of this yesterday, but
I had forgotten it. This morning, while we were
away, the priests came here and forced the boys
to draw cuts, without explaining what it was
for. Poor Pedro drew the lot, and was led away&mdash;he
knew not where.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Pedro, indeed!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;How did you
learn all this?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there was no secret about it afterward,&rdquo;
spoke up Archie, gloomily. &ldquo;They brought in
three of their precious priests dead as herrings,
and five that were badly done up and in need
of repairs. There was wild excitement in this
bungalow for a time, as you may guess, and it
didn&rsquo;t take us long to get the whole story from
the chattering, frightened crowd. It seemed poor
Pedro was dazed when first he discovered he was
to be sacrificed to the sun, and he walked like a
man in a dream to the slaughtering pen&mdash;up in
the great temple yonder. But he woke up when
they came at him with a knife, and died game,
like the brave fellow he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; continued Joe, taking up the thread
of the story, for Archie was trying to swallow a
lump in his throat, &ldquo;Pedro grabbed two of the
priests and bumped their heads together so fiercely
that their skulls cracked like egg-shells. Then
he caught another by the ankles and swung him
around, felling the crowd that rushed on him
with this living battering-ram. Living for a
time, that is, for when he finally let go the fellow
was mashed to a pulp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; added Ned Britton, &ldquo;they got
Pedro at last, as they were bound to do when his
strength gave out, and I suppose his heart&rsquo;s blood
is now in a golden pan, exposed to the rays of
their god the sun, who will drink it up. Pah!
Before they carved old Pedro, though, he yelled
out that he had given the sun a few extra sacrifices
to keep him company, and he only wished
there had been more in reach of his arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was dreadful,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;The old High
Priest had a fit, it seems, and they can&rsquo;t tell yet
whether he&rsquo;ll live or die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Ama there?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Archie, in an indignant tone.
&ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s as cold blooded as the rest of the
gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is her religion,&rdquo; declared Chaka, defending
her. &ldquo;She knows no better, and considers it just
and right to sacrifice to the Sun-God. But when
Pedro began to fight so desperately she at once
arose and retired from the scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This horrible news had rendered me as sad
and gloomy as the others. Silently we sat, wondering
if a similar fate would overtake us all. I,
being no longer in personal danger, reproached
myself for leaving my comrades at such a time;
yet I knew I could not have saved Pedro from
his fate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hereafter,&rdquo; said Ned, &ldquo;they intend to bind
the victims. This is the first time any one has
ever fought them, it seems, and the priests won&rsquo;t
take chances after this deadly experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad, Mars&rsquo; Sam,&rdquo; said Nux, regretfully.
&ldquo;I like to kill a few Tcha before I die, too. But
if dey ties me up, I sutt&rsquo;nly can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The result of Pedro&rsquo;s exploit was to render the
priests fearful of the rest of us. Our quarters
were that evening changed to a small wing at
the rear of their palace, which jutted out toward
the temple. It was but one story in height and
could be shut off entirely from the main building
by a heavily barred door. They gave us our supper&mdash;we
were always liberally fed&mdash;and then
closed the barrier between us.</p>
<p>Examining this new apartment I was surprised
to find it much less secure as a prison than our
former quarters. Indeed, it was no trouble at
all for any of us to lower ourselves from the window
to the ground. But evidently the priests
were more anxious about their own safety than
about ours, and there was little danger of the
sacrificial victims being able to escape very far,
even if they managed to avoid the guards at the
gates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>The air grew very oppressive this night and
the heat was intense&mdash;a new experience to us, for
we had found the nights cool. Toward morning
the wing in which we were confined began to
sway from side to side with a sickening motion,
and one lurch sent me rolling from my couch to
the stone floor.</p>
<p>As I sat up the commotion ceased as suddenly
as it had begun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An earthquake!&rdquo; exclaimed Paul, unmasking
the electric light. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder the building
didn&rsquo;t topple down on our heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are earthquakes common here?&rdquo; I asked
Chaka.</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not common,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but about once in a
lifetime we get some little shakes; nothing as
bad as this, though.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>Next morning the sun shone as serenely as
ever and when we walked out we found but little
damage had been done in the valley. But the
people had become sadly disquieted by the occurrence,
and the priests especially, for some secret
reason, were in a state of great fear and perturbation.
They talked excitedly among themselves
and sent constant messages to Ama, not using
the telephone because they feared we might overhear
them.</p>
<p>Suspecting that more trouble was brewing
Paul, Chaka and I resolved not to quit our comrades
this day, but remain and watch the course
of events. We had all been alike unsuccessful
the day before in locating our property, and now
we judged it wise to postpone the search to another
time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE FACE A DEADLY PERIL</span></h2>
<p>At noon Ama sent for us three and when we
arrived at her pavilion we found her pale and
distressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sun-God is angry with my people,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;because the sacrifice yesterday was violent
and destroyed three faithful priests. A new
sacrifice is called for, to placate the terrible deity
who rules the heavens and the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We stared at her aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sun-God is angry because you sacrificed
to him a helpless stranger, who worshipped a far
greater God than your sun,&rdquo; I said sternly.
&ldquo;Listen, Ama: if more of our comrades are sacrificed,
far greater harm will befall the Tcha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She regarded me half fearfully for a moment;
then her sweetest smile swept over her lovely face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>&ldquo;Samsteele,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the Tcha have sacrificed
to the great Sun-God for thousands of
years, and he has kept the nation prosperous and
happy in return. There is no power equal to the
power of the glorious Sun, and the Tcha are his
favored children.&rdquo; Her voice softened a little
as she added: &ldquo;If I could favor you, my friends,
I would not send your comrades to the sacrifice;
but the laws of my land and the jealousy of our
great god will not allow me to save them. Shall
I peril the welfare of all my people for the sake
of a few strangers? Impossible! The customs
of seven thousand years must be adhered to; the
majesty of our god must be sustained and his just
wrath appeased. I cannot help your friends. The
sacrifice must take place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo; asked Paul, looking at her with pleading
eyes until her own dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At sunset,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is to be chosen?&rdquo; I inquired
anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>&ldquo;The two big black men. My priests think
they will be more acceptable to our god than the
whites. Always when we have sacrificed any of
the Itzaex the mighty Sun has smiled upon us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ama,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we will not permit this. The
sacrifice shall not take place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sprang to her feet, tense and white with
anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall not?&rdquo; she cried: &ldquo;aye, but it <i>shall</i> take
place&mdash;at sunset this day! I, the High Priestess
of the Sun, have proclaimed it, and in the Vale
of Tcha there is no appeal from my edict.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was magnificent in her defiance, but I had
no heart to admire her just then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you murder those poor fellows their God&mdash;far
mightier than yours&mdash;will have revenge,&rdquo; I
said, trembling between fear and rage, for Nux
and Bryonia were very dear to me.</p>
<p>She drew herself up to her full height and
pointed at us a slender finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; she said imperiously.</p>
<p>Never had we seen the girl in this mood before.
Her eyes were cold and hard as rocks, her
lips set with firm determination, her poise queenly
and aggressive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>We turned slowly and left the august presence,
realizing that Ama, however beautiful and bewitching
she might be in repose, was a veritable
tigress when aroused to defend the faith in which
she had been reared.</p>
<p>Even the sky had grown dark during our interview,
and the sun had withdrawn his face as
if in shame that any benighted race should sacrifice
human lives in his honor. The purple-gray
mask of the sky was so unusual at this season of
the year&mdash;perhaps at all seasons, so far as we
knew&mdash;that it was little wonder the superstitious
Tcha interpreted the sign as one of anger from
their outraged deity, whose altar had been the
scene of strife.</p>
<p>Returning to our friends we were loth to tell
them of the fate in store for our honest blacks.
Indeed, it was but a preface to the fate that
awaited them all unless we could find a way to
resist the all powerful Tcha. Finally, as the
day drew on, Chaka had an idea and beckoned to
Paul and me to follow him. We were permitted
to go wherever we pleased, whereas the others
were forbidden to leave their room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>&ldquo;The High Priest is gentle,&rdquo; whispered the
atkayma, when we were outside. &ldquo;Let us plead
with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We knew that the old dotard dwelt in the most
splendid suite in the building, so we made our
way toward it. A guard informed us that his
Highness was ill, and could not be disturbed. We
tried to argue the point, but the man would not
relent. No one but Ama might intrude upon his
master.</p>
<p>Saddened by this rebuff we wended our way
back to our wing, only to confront another disappointment.
Orders had been received from
the High Priestess to forbid our mingling with
the sacrificial devotees. We were to be allowed
the privileges of every citizen of the valley, but
the laws forbade a citizen from associating with
those condemned to the sacrifice.</p>
<p>And here was our old acquaintance the Waba
Pagatka guarding the passage with a file of his
soldiers, all fully armed. Protest was useless,
and so helpless did we feel that our eyes, as we
gazed at one another, were filled with black
despair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>We went out and wandered aimlessly around
the temple enclosure. Even the grounds outside
the wing where our friends were confined were
now guarded, so we were unable to approach them
from that side.</p>
<p>The sky was growing blacker and more threatening.
Not a breath of air stirred. Even the
birds had ceased to sing. There was a mystical
hush in the atmosphere that was appalling. The
priests going to and fro between the temple and
their palace noted these unusual portents and
turned frightened glances upward, as if seeking
to propitiate their angry god.</p>
<p>I wondered if, seeing there was no sun, and
therefore no sunset, the sacrifice would be postponed;
but before long my doubts were set at
rest. The fatuous priests were even hurrying
the ceremonies, for presently a gorgeous procession
issued from the palace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>All the members of their order were in full
regalia, the silver emblems of the sun glittering
on their breasts. In their midst walked, or
rather tottered, Nux and Bryonia, the two gigantic
blacks being so weak that they could scarcely
move without assistance. Their hands were tied
securely behind their backs. Afterward we
learned that the an&aelig;sthetic perfume had again
been employed to render all our friends unconscious
and incapable of resisting. Then Nux and
Bry had been bound and carried out before they
had fully revived.</p>
<p>At the same time that the procession of priests
issued forth, marching with stately tread despite
their nervous fears, a similar procession of the
Virgins of the Sun, with Ama at their head, appeared
from the opposite enclosure.</p>
<p>The iron gates had been thrown wide and a
vast concourse of people had assembled to witness
the sacrifice. They stood silent and watchful, for
none was permitted to enter the temple until the
priestesses and priests had taken their places
within.</p>
<p>A short distance from the entrance the two
files united, side by side approaching the sacred
edifice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>Paul, Chaka and I stood silently by, helplessly
watching the terrible ceremony. I strained my
eyes for a last sight of my faithful followers, believing
their doom to be sealed.</p>
<p>The procession had begun to mount the steps
of the temple when a subdued roaring sound became
audible, followed by a crash resembling a
thunder-clap. The ground heaved up before us
and sent us all three sprawling upon our faces.
Crash after crash now resounded throughout the
valley and I sprang to my feet in time to see part
of the great temple wall bend outward and fall in
a mass of debris. Rocks from the near-by wall
of the mountain began to rattle down like hailstones
and the darkness was even greater than
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ama!&rdquo; cried Paul; and &ldquo;Ama!&rdquo; shrieked
Chaka in return; but they could not go to her at
the moment, hard as they tried. We clung together
like drunken men, striving for a foothold
while the ground rolled and groaned beneath
our feet and our ears were filled with the screams
of women and the hoarse cries of men. Priests
and priestesses were flying in every direction,
and we saw Ama the center of a group of maidens
that managed to gain their enclosure and slam
shut the gates&mdash;as if that would do any good, or
shut out the awful earthquake! It relieved both
Paul and Chaka, however, to know the girl was
safe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>The people who had gathered for the sacrifice
suffered most, I think, for they were massed together
and only those on the outskirts could scuttle
away through the streets, where many met
death from falling walls and rocks. The moans
of the maimed and dying were blood curdling,
and I could hardly bear to hear them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; I gasped; &ldquo;let us find Nux and Bry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew, of course, we were experiencing another
earthquake&mdash;a frightful one this time&mdash;but
there was nothing we could do for ourselves or
others, unless we might find and save the blacks.</p>
<p>This proved not difficult. We came across
them at the steps of the ruined temple, Bry lying
flat while Nux knelt beside him, still bound. The
priests had deserted them in the attempt to save
their own lives. In a flash I whipped out my
knife and set both the poor fellows free. We
then raised Bry, to find he was stunned but very
little hurt. Between us we supported them, trying
to make our way back to our quarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>Parts of the palace of the priests had split open
or caved in, but our one-story wing seemed not
to have suffered from the quake, which was by
this time reduced to a few minor tremors.</p>
<p>Being afraid to enter the palace&mdash;from whence
guards and priests had alike fled&mdash;we reached
the window outside our wing and our shouts
brought the pallid faces of Joe and Archie to the
opening. We hoisted Bry up to them and they
dragged him bodily into the room. Nux was
able to climb in himself, and Paul, Chaka and I
quickly followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Ned?&rdquo; I asked, looking around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went out to skirmish for you,&rdquo; said Joe.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all been out, during the worst of it, but
Archie and I thought you&rsquo;d get back here as soon
as you could, and we concluded it&rsquo;s just as safe
here as anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess the city&rsquo;s pretty well broken up,&rdquo; added
Archie, gazing from the window into the blackness
that was only relieved by the glow from the
light within our room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen earthquakes
in my day, but this beats all that&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped
with a sort of gasp and a moment later cried out:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him! Gee willikins&mdash;it&rsquo;s him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; we exclaimed, running to the opening.</p>
<p>Limping slowly toward the wing and supported
by Ned Britton came Pedro, who we supposed
had been sacrificed to the Sun-God the evening
before. His clothes were torn nearly to shreds
and there was a look of terror and suffering on
his face that was pitiable to behold as the dim
light struck it.</p>
<p>Paul leaped out to assist Ned in hoisting the
Mexican to the window ledge, and we others
drew him in as tenderly as we could. He sank
on a couch with a moan, limp as a rag.</p>
<p>We gave him water first, and then a swallow
of spirits from Paul&rsquo;s flask, but when we questioned
him he stared at us silently and shook his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find him?&rdquo; some one asked
Ned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>&ldquo;Beside the temple. The wall had fallen down
and a big part of the marble floor heaved up and
then tumbled into a cellar underneath. I had an
idea Nux and Bry might be in the ruins, and
while I peered about me a head was pushed up
from the cellar and I recognized Pedro. It gave
me a shock, I can tell you, for we thought he was
dead. The marble blocks were yet rocking and
tilting pretty lively, but I made a dash and
dragged Pedro out to a safer place. He was
nearly done up, but I managed to get him here,
as you see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE BECOME AGGRESSIVE</span></h2>
<p>After a little time the Mexican began to recover
his self possession, and with it his tongue.
We found he was nearly starved, so we fed him
sparingly and gave him a bit more of the spirits.
By and by, a little at a time he told his story.</p>
<p>His struggles with the priests was much as we
had heard it described, except in one important
particular. Pedro fought so desperately that
he dismayed his opponents, and during the
m&ecirc;l&eacute;e one of them touched a spring that released
a trap in the floor, precipitating the Mexican
into a dark cellar underneath. When freed
of his weight the block of stone swung into place
again, and he found himself in a veritable dungeon,
so far as light and air were concerned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p>The cowardly priests left him there, announcing
that he had been sacrificed, as they feared to
admit to the people that he had gotten the best
of them in the fight. Pedro&rsquo;s leg had been hurt
by the fall, and it caused him a good deal of pain.
The air was close and damp and full of musty
odors.</p>
<p>After a time the prisoner began to crawl
around, and found the place was used partly as
a storehouse, as it contained many bales and
parcels of various wares. Having a few matches
in his pocket Pedro lighted one of them and right
before his face discovered our electrites and storage-battery
belts, all in a heap. He hunted around
for our gas-jackets, but they were not there.
When his matches gave out he lay still in the dark
and wondered what would happen to him. Probably
the priests intended he should starve to death,
and he was getting weak and hungry when the
earthquake came. The earth swayed all around
him, the building crumbled away and the marble
floor heaved up and burst open, many of the
marble blocks dropping into the cellar&mdash;fortunately
not in his neighborhood. Pedro was
frightened nearly out of his wits, but seeing dimly
that a way of escape had opened up he climbed
upon a heap of marble, stuck out his head, and
found Ned Britton watching him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>When he had drawn this story from the Mexican&mdash;and
it took him a long time to tell it&mdash;we
decided to assume the defensive and aggressive
and take a firm stand against the priesthood, our
most vicious enemies.</p>
<p>The cries and moans of the stricken ones were
gradually dying away and white robed priests
began to steal back to their dwelling&mdash;such as had
escaped injury, that is.</p>
<p>We examined the doorway to our wing and
found the heavy metal doors that sealed it from
communication with the rest of the palace. Preferring
to have them remain open we managed
to bend and wedge them in such a way that they
could not again be closed upon us, as had been
done when our comrades had been overcome by
the an&aelig;sthetic. We fixed the metal window-slide
the same way, and being now assured that we
could no longer be confined in the room against
our will we held a council to decide our future
actions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>Presently there came to us the tall, thin priest
whom we had noted as one in authority under the
aged High Priest. His face was shrunken and
his eyes, shrewd and roving in expression, were
sunk in great hollows. His lips were so thin that
they did not cover his protruding teeth and on his
chin was a straggling beard of dark red. This
fellow&mdash;his name was Katalat&mdash;had attracted our
notice not only because of his repulsive appearance
but for the reason that all the other priests
deferred to him and he was openly antagonistic
to our party. He had had little to say to us until
now, but when he came into our room he cast a
vengeful, vindictive glance around and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great god is very angry. See how he
has punished us for not sacrificing all of you, and
at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See how he has punished you for daring to
harm any of us,&rdquo; I retorted angrily. &ldquo;If your
god had desired our lives he would not have saved
us from injury and destroyed so many of your
own people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me wickedly. I think he was
clever enough to know that the sun had nothing
whatever to do with the earthquake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<p>&ldquo;The noble High Priest Pentchakoma is dead,&rdquo;
he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad!&rdquo; said Paul, heartily. &ldquo;Did the
earthquake frighten the old man, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The roof fell upon him. And now I, Katalat,
have by our laws become High Priest in his stead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Ama appointed you so soon?&rdquo; inquired
Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The High Priestess has nothing to do with the
appointment. It is the law,&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she is the Supreme Ruler,&rdquo; said Chaka.
&ldquo;If she does not approve&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <i>must</i> approve!&rdquo; cried Katalat fiercely.
&ldquo;Otherwise&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what then?&rdquo; asked Paul, as he paused.</p>
<p>The telephone bell rang. We had placed the
instrument just outside our room, in the passage,
so it would be convenient to the priests and to us.
I started to answer the summons, but the priest
blocked my way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;I forbid you to communicate
again with the High Priestess.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p>Paul nodded to Ned, who reached out an arm,
grabbed Katalat by the collar and whirled him
into a corner, where the big mate stood guard
over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer the telephone, Sam,&rdquo; said Allerton.</p>
<p>As I went I heard the priest vowing dire vengeance.
It was Ama calling as I had expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you&mdash;is&mdash;is&mdash;are <i>any</i> of you hurt?&rdquo; she
inquired, stammering in her anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we are all safe. And you, Ama?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am broken hearted! My poor people! My
poor city!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The city can be fixed
up again and more people will grow. Do you
want us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now. Come to me early to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will if the priests let us. There&rsquo;s an
ugly fellow here now, named Katalat, who says
he&rsquo;s the new High Priest and forbids our seeing
you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a brief silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beware of Katalat,&rdquo; Ama said, in a hesitating
voice. &ldquo;I fear trouble ahead for us all. Come
to-morrow, if you can&mdash;all of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she severed the connection and I went
back to make my report.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better settle with this
High Priest right now&mdash;for good and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; asked Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By wringing his neck.&rdquo; Then, still speaking
in English, I repeated what Ama had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t murder him in cold blood,&rdquo; remarked
our leader, looking at Katalat thoughtfully;
&ldquo;nor can we allow him to lead a rebellion
against us, and perhaps against Ama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us keep him a prisoner until morning,&rdquo;
suggested Chaka, in his quiet way. &ldquo;After we
have seen the Supreme Ruler we can better decide
what to do with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That seemed good advice, so we told Archie
and Joe to bind the priest and gag him. He
fought desperately at first, but Joe had a ju-jutsu
trick that quickly laid old Katalat on his back,
and Archie stuffed a cloth into his mouth and
silenced his cries. One or two priests, hearing
the scrimmage, came pattering along the passage,
but Paul and Chaka met them and sent them
away again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p>Night had fallen by this time and as soon as it
was quite dark&mdash;it had been gloomy enough before&mdash;Allerton
suggested that some of us form a
party to go for the electrites. We left Nux and
Bryonia, quite recovered by this time, with Ned
and Pedro to guard our prisoner, while the rest
of us set out for the temple by way of the open
window.</p>
<p>There was not a star in the sky, but fortunately
Paul had retained his dark lantern and we depended
upon that to assist us when we got to the
temple. Until then we dared not show a light.
We stumbled over rubbish and debris at every
step, and once or twice, as we neared the temple,
I recoiled as my foot touched something that I
instinctively felt was a dead body.</p>
<p>Finally we came to the ruined wall and after
climbing over the scattered blocks of marble Paul
got out his lantern to guide us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<p>We found the hole in the floor and after lighting
up the aperture and sending a ray into the
basement to show us the way, Allerton handed the
lamp to Chaka and dropped lightly into the cellar.
It was a rather risky proceeding, for the great
building was in a dangerous condition. Only one
wall had actually fallen, but the others were more
or less cracked and displaced, while some of the
huge blocks of marble that had formed the coping
were liable to topple down upon us at any moment.
Nor was the flooring any too secure. But Joe
and I followed Allerton without hesitation and
then Chaka handed us the lamp. Presently, amid
bales and boxes of curious shapes we came across
our property, and passed the belts and electrites
from one to another until Archie and Chaka received
them above and laid them in a pile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s get out of this,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too
dangerous to suit me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; called Paul, who had been
turning the light in every direction. As he spoke
he clambered over some bales and then pounced
upon some object he had discovered. It proved to
be the extra gas-jacket that had been taken from
our chest, and Joe and I both uttered shouts of joy
at its recovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The others may be here, too,&rdquo; I exclaimed, my
fears all forgotten. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s search for them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<p>We did, but without result. We came across
one or two minor articles that had seemed suspicious
to the Tcha who rifled our chests, but no
firearms nor any more of the gas-jackets were in
the cellar of the temple. Finally we climbed out
of the hole again and, carefully securing the belts
and electrites, made our way back to our quarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XXIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE WITNESS A DARING DEED</span></h2>
<p>Having armed ourselves with the electrites, each
putting on a fresh belt, we concealed the precious
gas-jacket beneath a divan. True, there was but
one for nine of us, but it meant that one person in
the party, at least, would be able to leave the valley
at will, and that counted for a good deal with
those in our present uncomfortable position. Paul
even thought the inflated jacket might be made to
float two, at a pinch. At present there was no
suggestion of any one&rsquo;s taking advantage of the
find to run away from his comrades; but it was a
satisfaction to us all to know we had recovered
the jacket. Plenty of themlyne crystals were in
the chest left to us, and the little case attached to
the jacket was filled with them, in readiness for
any emergency.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<p>None of us slept much during the rest of that
eventful night, unless it was Pedro, who was so
exhausted he needed to regain his former strength.
Next morning we foraged for breakfast, not permitting
any of the priests to enter the room lest
they spy their leader as our prisoner. They were
a very subdued crowd, by this time, and gave us
no trouble.</p>
<p>But the question was how to visit Ama in a
bunch, as she had requested, and still leave old
Katalat a safe prisoner in our room. Finally we
solved the problem by deciding to take him with
us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that we are armed,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;even the
Waba Pagatka will hesitate to interfere with us.
But the valley is so utterly demoralized just now
that I scarcely think we shall be attacked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sky still retained its sombre hue, and Nux,
who was born in a land subject to earthquakes,
shook his head and predicted more trouble for the
Vale of Tcha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When one quake come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;three quakes
come. Each is more badder than de odder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<p>We had had two already, and anything worse
than last night&rsquo;s performance was surely to be
dreaded. But we were not borrowing trouble
just then.</p>
<p>We found great confusion in the quarters of the
priestesses. Their palace had not suffered so
much damage as that of the priests, but huge
stones from the mountain side littered the ground
everywhere. The beauty of this retreat was
evidently spoiled for some time to come.</p>
<p>We had met with no interference on the way,
although the priests gathered to watch us march
their leader away as our prisoner. Ama, however,
was startled to see Katalat in bonds and at
once ordered us to release him. We did so reluctantly,
and when she demanded an explanation
Paul said we considered the new High Priest
dangerous to us all. Katalat smiled grimly at
hearing this, but said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a Tcha,&rdquo; remarked Ama, proudly, &ldquo;and
a faithful servant of our great and glorious god,
the Sun. In his youth he was our record-keeper
and librarian, being skilled in literature and the
arts. Such a one can be dangerous only to the
enemies of the Tcha.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">290</div>
<p>But she was too distressed over the condition
of the valley and her dead and suffering subjects
to dwell upon this incident long, and eagerly she
begged us to advise her what to do to restore a
semblance of order and comfort as quickly as
possible. Being travelers of wide experience, she
added, we ought to know how to handle such a
condition better than the Tcha, who were seemingly
stunned by their misfortune&mdash;the first of its
kind that had overtaken them since they had occupied
the valley thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>We counseled her as well as we could, and it
seemed a good omen that just then the sun appeared
in the sky and sent his warming rays to
flood the stricken valley. Of me the girl seemed
much afraid, saying I had predicted the calamity
that had overtaken them, and in addition to being
a seer she imagined I might be a wizard, as well,
and by diabolical arts had wrought all this desolation.
It amused me to be accorded such powers,
but I am sorry to feel that pretty Ama was afraid
of me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">291</div>
<p>Paul suggested that she call a meeting of the
principal inhabitants at the great theatre, or assembly
hall, and there give them instructions what
to do, as well as an encouraging speech. She
caught at this plan eagerly and dispatched her
messengers at once. Meantime Chaka and Allerton
gave the girl much good advice, and Archie
and Joe aided them quite effectually. She would
not listen to me at all, so I kept silent.</p>
<p>All this time the new High Priest stood dumbly
listening to the conservation. He took no part
in the conference himself, even when the Supreme
Ruler appealed to him, and I thought his conduct
that of a cad and a cur. After Ama he held the
highest rank in the Vale, and it certainly was his
duty to assist her in her present trouble. But no;
he kept his mouth shut and his wild roving eyes
fixed intently on our faces.</p>
<p>Presently the messengers returned to say that
the people were assembling at the theatre, and
Ama immediately prepared to join them. She
must deck herself in her imperial robes, it seemed;
so we were requested to meet her just at the edge
of the city and accompany her to the meeting.
She noticed our electrites but did not ask in
what manner we had recovered them. Also she
noted Pedro&rsquo;s presence, and that the supposed
sacrifice was still alive and well; but not a word
concerning him passed her lips. She was intent
on more important matters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">292</div>
<p>While we waited in the grounds Chaka made a
trip to our room and put on the gas-jacket, covering
it with his flowing tunic. This he did at
Allerton&rsquo;s request. The High Priest, being now
free, had rejoined his satellites and we saw them
all whispering together before they marched away
in a body to the meeting. Doubtless old Katalat
meant to cause trouble, if he could.</p>
<p>We followed them slowly, halting just without
the circle of buildings to wait for Ama. I
thought she would come in the golden electric
chariot she used on state occasions, but because of
the rocks and debris that cluttered the way she
was obliged to walk.</p>
<p>The High Priestess and her escort made an
impressive appearance, nevertheless. First came
six young girls swinging censers; then Ama alone.
Following her were the Virgins of the Sun in
their snow-white gowns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">293</div>
<p>At her signal we went ahead and were approaching
near to the theatre when the final
calamity overtook this devoted land.</p>
<p>The clear sky had nothing to do with the third
earthquake. It came unheralded, without an instant&rsquo;s
warning. A sound as of a heavy sea dashing
against breakers was followed by so mighty a
crash that every living creature in the Vale of
Tcha reeled and fell headlong.</p>
<p>It was all over, then. A mere instant had
wrecked the beautiful city and buried hundreds in
its ruins. More than that, as we rose dazed and
trembling to our feet we saw that the south end
of the huge mountain had split in twain, and
through the rift we could look far out upon the
plains toward the Great Lake and the City of
Itza.</p>
<p>But now another horror confronted us. The
ground of the valley had likewise split into big
cracks, one of them almost at our feet. The
censer girls had disappeared; the Virgins had likewise
been swallowed up or had rushed back to
firmer land. But there, upon a tiny island formed
by two irregular chasms, stood Ama, erect and
motionless, while the bit of ground that supported
her slight and beautiful form swayed visibly
to and fro, as if hesitating which way to
plunge its fair burden into the black gulf below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">294</div>
<p>I saw a flash and felt a rush of air past me as
Chaka made a great leap and alighted at the girl&rsquo;s
feet. For a moment I thought they were both
about to be engulfed, but he steadied her with one
hand as he knelt beside her, while with the other
he fumbled with the valve of the themlyne case.
He had cast aside his tunic before he made that
wonderful leap, and as we stood spellbound,
watching him with throbbing hearts, we could see
the gas-jacket slowly swell as the powerful gas
was generated and rushed into it.</p>
<p>It seemed a desperate chance to take; there was
scarcely any foundation to support the swaying
bit of ground, which was crumbling away before
our very eyes. A few seconds now would end it
all, and we stared helplessly, with a sickening
dread of the impending tragedy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">295</div>
<p>Chaka straightened up, gained his feet and
passed an arm around Ama&rsquo;s waist. She appeared
not to notice him; her face was white and
set, her eyes turned steadily ahead to the spot
where Paul stood with clasped hands, praying as
he had never before prayed in all his life.</p>
<p>Chaka and Ama swayed with the little island,
which toppled and fell with a roar into the abyss.
Slowly&mdash;slowly but surely&mdash;they two sank after
it, the girl clasped tightly in the atkayma&rsquo;s arms,
and disappeared from our view.</p>
<p>Archie and I caught Allerton as he sank unconscious
and inert to the ground. Joe had run
away, for some reason. I was scarcely able to
stand, myself, and the cry of horror from the
throng of people who, rushing from the theatre,
had witnessed this scene, conspired to unman me
still further.</p>
<p>But a sudden revulsion of feeling came, for
above the huge crack appeared Chaka&rsquo;s head&mdash;rising,
gradually rising, an inch at a time&mdash;until
he was again in full view, the girl still clasped in
his arms. She had fainted, and lay with her
golden red hair streaming over the atkayma&rsquo;s
shoulder.</p>
<p>We shouted for joy, then, and all the Tcha behind
us echoed the shout, for once startled out of
their inbred apathy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">296</div>
<p>Straight up, to some twenty feet above the
chasm&rsquo;s edge floated Chaka, and then remained
stationary. The gas-jacket was inflated to its
fullest extent, but was not light enough to carry
the double burden higher. No air stirred; here
was no way to succor the pair, it seemed, or bring
them to firm ground.</p>
<p>We had reckoned without Joe, however. I never
knew where the boy found that rope, or how he
came to think of running search of it. But now
the line shot into the air, in true sailor- or cowboy-fashion,
and Chaka managed to grab it with
one hand while he clung to Ama with the other.
Then Joe slowly and steadily drew them away
from their dangerous position to where we stood
with outstretched arms eager to receive them.</p>
<p>The assistance came none too soon, for the gas
was escaping through a defect in the valve and
without the aid of the rope Chaka would soon
have made a second and final descent into the gulf.
As it was, he was barely above the edge when we
drew him in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">297</div>
<p>The Maya was as calm and cool as if no danger
had threatened him. Some Tcha women brought
water and took charge of Paul and the High
Priestess, trying to restore them to consciousness.
While they worked, without warning the crack
came together with a sound like a thunder-clap,
the impact throwing us all upon our faces again.
Only an uneven ridge of crumpled earth marked
the line where the great jagged opening had extended
half way across the valley.</p>
<p>Chaka, standing beside me, gave an involuntary
shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was fire below us,&rdquo; he said in an awed
tone, &ldquo;and that was what caused Ama to faint.
Under this mountain is a great volcano. It has
been burning for countless ages, biding its time,
and the people knew it not until the crouching
monster rose to-day in its might and vanquished
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;The cleft in the mountain
side is still open. Beyond is your own
country, Chaka.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, with an accent of sadness;
&ldquo;the hidden city is hidden no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">298</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE REPEL THE INVADERS</span></h2>
<p>Allerton was soon himself again and assisted in
rubbing the girl&rsquo;s hands to restore their circulation,
while Chaka, who had saved her life with
such admirable courage, stood passively by regarding
the scene.</p>
<p>Presently Ama opened her eyes, and naturally
the first thing they fell upon was Paul&rsquo;s anxious
face. She smiled at him, sighed, and stirred uneasily
as the recollection of the fearful experience
through which she had passed slowly dawned
upon her. Then she sat up and struggled to her
feet, gazing with horror at her ruined city and
the vista of the Itzaex country that showed
through the riven mountain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">299</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she said, and without heeding her
own people, who flocked about her, she extended
one hand to Chaka, the other to Paul, and supported
between them staggered away to examine
the extent of the damage.</p>
<p>One would expect wild excitement in the valley
now; but the Tcha were a queer race. Those
who had been saved from injury by assembling at
the theatre sat down where they were and gazed
in mute despair at the ruins of the splendid city
they had known and loved so well. Even the
priests were completely demoralized and I saw
our enemy Katalat, wrapped in his robe, standing
silent and alone, his glassy eyes fixed on the
ground at his feet, as if lost in thought.</p>
<p>After all there was little to blame in the demeanor
of the Tcha. The race having existed
in this favored spot for centuries upon centuries,
the present inhabitants had had no thought of insecurity.
So suddenly had the earthquakes and
their attendant misfortunes come upon them that
they were stunned for the time and incapable of
action, or even logical thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">300</div>
<p>Ama moaned and wept at every step of her
progress through the city. There was hardly a
building that had escaped damage; by far the
majority were irretrievably demolished. The
artisans&rsquo; quarters had suffered most, as their
buildings were not as strongly built as the others,
and hundreds of dead were buried under the walls
of their home.</p>
<p>The poor girl could not bear the sad sights for
long. Even with our assistance, which we earnestly
volunteered, little could be done in this hour
of disaster to relieve the stricken ones; so presently
Ama turned toward her own palace.</p>
<p>Here was more desolation, but parts of the vast
building still remained intact and the rooms occupied
by the High Priestess were yet habitable. Of
the fifty attendant priestesses only about thirty had
escaped death, the others having been swallowed
up when the earth opened. The survivors were
wailing dismally when we arrived, and there was
no way to comfort them.</p>
<p>Ama withdrew to her rooms and shut herself
up. We did not see her again for three days.
Meantime we resumed our former quarters in the
one-story wing of the priests&rsquo; palace, which was
about all there was left of that building. Katalat
and his followers took possession of the prison,
which being low and solid had escaped damage,
and for a time we heard nothing of them, either.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">301</div>
<p>I proposed to our party that we collect such
stores of food as we would find and a few more
rubies and make our way back through the Itzaex
country to the ship. Paul said we could go if we
wished, but for his part he intended to stay until
Ama was out of her trouble. Chaka declared he
would stay also. There was no use in arguing
with them, for they both loved the girl; so of
course we all stayed. No one can desert a comrade
at such a time.</p>
<p>On the evening of the third day a Tcha who had
been put to guard the rift in the mountain came
running to say that a great horde of Itzaex warriors
was marching toward us and had encamped
for the night but three hours&rsquo; distant from the city.</p>
<p>When this news reached Ama she sent for us at
once, asking what could be done to protect her
people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are your future plans?&rdquo; asked Paul,
calmly. &ldquo;Do you intend to rebuild the city?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">302</div>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Already I have consulted
with the Tribunal, with the High Priest
Katalat and with my principal nobles, and we
have determined to erect a new city upon these
ruins. But it will take many years to do this and
my people have not yet recovered from the shock
of their misfortunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that the mountain side is split open and
a path made into the valley,&rdquo; said Allerton, &ldquo;all
the world will be coming here, and you cannot
prevent it. Here are the Itzaex now, bent on conquering
the remnants of the Tcha and plundering
you of your treasures. They are merely the forerunners
of others to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wrung her hands in abject despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;Oh, what
shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fight!&rdquo; said Chaka, suddenly. The Itzaex
were his own people, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll help to drive them away,&rdquo; declared
Archie, enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Paul was thoughtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much of a fighting force can you command?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">303</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Public Guardians have always been sufficient
for our purposes,&rdquo; said Ama. &ldquo;They number
one hundred and are commanded by the Waba
Pagatka. But I think every man in the valley will
willingly fight to protect us from our foes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who leads the miners?&rdquo; was his next question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their chief, a Tcha named Ampax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send for him, and also for Pagatka,&rdquo; he requested.</p>
<p>She dispatched messengers at once.</p>
<p>Pagatka came first and saluted the High Priestess
with his usual deference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gather all your men,&rdquo; said Ama, &ldquo;and take
them to the opening the earthquake has made in
the mountain. You are to guard us against the
Itzaex, who will attack us early in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have but eighty men left alive,&rdquo; he stated.
&ldquo;The Itzaex are thousands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have possession of the pass,&rdquo; said
Paul, &ldquo;and I and my comrades will be there to
help you. At all hazards the Itzaex must be kept
from entering the valley. If they succeed they
will kill without mercy every inhabitant.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">304</div>
<p>The Waba asserted he would do all in his
power, and retired to assemble his men. Like all
the rest of his people he was completely discouraged
and had no hope of making a successful
resistance.</p>
<p>When the miner, Ampax, arrived he proved to
be a fine big fellow with a bushy beard of fiery red
and keen, steadfast eyes. He was asked to get
together all the men of his caste that he could and
raise a rampart of stones across the mouth of the
pass. As this was nearly a hundred feet in width
it seemed a herculean task; but Ampax promptly
undertook to do all that was possible. We liked
this fellow. In this crisis he was the most capable
Tcha we had found.</p>
<p>All night the miners labored at the pass and
many others of the Tcha, when they understood
the matter, willingly assisted them. The ground
was well littered with rocks and blocks of marble
from ruined buildings, so material was close at
hand. By daybreak a barrier had been erected
nearly five feet in height entirely across the opening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_305">305</div>
<p>Waba Pagatka came with his men, fully armed
with spears and battle-axes, and the soldiers were
lined up behind the barrier. Ama had ordered
our firearms and ammunition returned to us, and
these, supplemented by our electrites, made our
little party of nine more formidable than the eighty
soldiers of Pagatka. But the Tcha were at last
beginning to take a lively interest in their own
welfare and at daybreak volunteers began to join
our ranks in fair numbers, among them several of
the priesthood. They came armed very primitively
with whatever weapons they could pick up. Axes,
knives and heavy clubs were the chief of these,
and there were a few bows and arrows brought
out, but not many. Never in the lifetime of this
generation had they been called upon to fight a
battle; but they were a calm and determined lot,
in spite of their inexperience, and we looked for
them to render a good account of themselves.</p>
<p>Altogether we mustered that morning some four
hundred men all told, and opposed to us were
more than five thousand skilled Itzaex warriors,
the bravest and fiercest fighters I have ever known.
Really, our case seemed desperate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_306">306</div>
<p>The enemy broke camp at daybreak and marched
up the mountain in good military order. At their
head was borne aloft an open palanquin, upon
which reclined a man who was doubtless their
leader. Paul examined him through his field
glasses and declared he was none other than our
old enemy Datchapa. How the ancient uncle of
the atkayma had managed to survive his tumble
down the pyramid was a wonder; but he had, and
of course he had soon recovered from the shock
of the electrite.</p>
<p>The attack of the Itzaex was now fully explained.
Chaka&rsquo;s father, believing his son dead,
had before his own demise confided the secret of
the hidden city to Datchapa, who would become
his successor. Doubtless he included in the tale
a description of the beauty and riches of the city
and valley. So when the earthquake came and
the Itzaex saw the mountain rent asunder and a
passage opened, old Datchapa had quickly decided
to invade and conquer the stricken and helpless
kingdom of the Tcha. That secluded race was
certainly unprepared to oppose such an invasion,
never having dreamed of trouble with their neighbors,
the Itzaex, which proved how little they understood
the savage nature of the tribe surrounding
their retreat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_307">307</div>
<p>The sun had risen brilliantly when the attack
began. The Itzaex were probably surprised at
sight of the rampart which had sprung up in a
single night, but they did not hesitate to advance
upon it. Datchapa halted his palanquin to one
side, but quite near the scene of action, and sat up,
propped by his cushions, to direct the battle. I
imagine his fall had broken some limbs that were
slowly mending, but the old fellow&rsquo;s energetic
spirit urged him to lead his people on this momentous
occasion in spite of his injuries.</p>
<p>Our party of nine was stationed close to the
barrier, one every ten feet or so from the next,
thus forming a line that controlled the entire
space. All around us stood the defenders awaiting
with composure the attack.</p>
<p>A shower of darts directed toward us did no
harm at all, because we escaped them by simply
ducking our heads. Arrows were likewise harmless.
The Itzaex understood the situation and
with savage cries swung their clubs and battle-axes
and bounded forward to scale the rampart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">308</div>
<p>We used our repeating rifles, cutting into their
front ranks with fearful effect; but the enemy
came on undaunted. The Tcha now leaped to the
top of the wall and from their point of vantage
fought so desperately, yet coolly, that after some
ten minutes of hand to hand conflict the Itzaex retreated
to gain breath and reform their ranks.
They left scores of dead and dying before the
barrier, but our own forces had suffered severely,
too. I was proud of the Tcha at that moment.
They were fully as fearless as their enemies and
made a capital defense when you consider they had
never been trained for warfare.</p>
<p>The big miner Ampax touched Paul&rsquo;s arm and
pointed to a great cliff that far up on the mountain&rsquo;s
edge overhung the pass. The earthquake,
in rending Aota&rsquo;s side, had left this tremendous
mass suspended by a small neck of rock. I had
not noticed the thing before, as from inside the
valley the slender connection was not clearly seen,
and during the darkness of the night it had also
escaped the notice of the miners. But Ampax had
spied it in the nick of time, and as I gazed up at
the thing now it looked mighty dangerous to
those who stood below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can break off that mass,&rdquo; said Ampax, &ldquo;it
will block the pass.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_309">309</div>
<p>Paul nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try it,&rdquo; he replied, and at once Ampax selected
a dozen assistants who, laden with bars and
mattocks of heavy bronze, began to climb the side
of the cliff, using a path that a goat would have
hesitated to attempt.</p>
<p>Allerton called me to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in our chest is a stick of dynamite.
It is wrapped in foil and is kept in a padded
box marked &lsquo;XXD&rsquo;. Run and get it, my lad, and
carry it to Ampax as quickly as you can. You
know how to use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will there be time?&rdquo; I inquired, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. With our electrites and the rifles
we ought to be able to drive those savages back
once or twice more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Paul; I&rsquo;m off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Handing my firearms to Pagatka, who ought to
do some good with them, for he was an intelligent
fellow, I sprinted as fast as I was able to back to our
quarters. The rift in the mountain was at the
south end, nearly a quarter of a mile distant from
the temple enclosure; but it took a little time to
unlock the chest and secure the dynamite.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_310">310</div>
<p>Taking the precious box under my arm I hastily
started to return when I came upon Ama standing
with a group of her women at a point where her
eyes could command the pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>I pointed up the mountain toward the great
mass of rock that overhung the opening, explaining
that only a small neck of rock held it in place
and Ampax was trying to break it away so as to
block up the pass. I added that in the box was a
powerful explosive that would assist the miner in
his task, and that we must hurry or the Itzaex
would have broken through the defense before we
could accomplish our object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The climb is what I dread,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
dizzy path, and I&rsquo;m not sure I can make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will guide you,&rdquo; she suddenly exclaimed.
&ldquo;Follow me, Samsteele!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning, she ran lightly back to the temple enclosure,
and after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation I decided
to follow her. We were not heading for
the pass at all, yet Ama ought to know her own
mountain better than I did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_311">311</div>
<p>The girl proved a swift runner and I, being already
short of breath, had no easy job to keep up
with her. As we dashed into the gardens surrounding
Ama&rsquo;s ruined pavilion the battle cry of
the fierce Itzaex again resounded in our ears and
we realized that another attack upon the barrier
had begun.</p>
<p>Ama entered the big cavern in the mountain,
where I had never before been. We skirted a
bathing pool, fed by springs that gushed from the
rocks, and quite at the rear end of the place came
to a small passage. It was black as ink, but Ama
took my hand and drew me after her along the
passage, scarcely abating her speed as she went.</p>
<p>The tunnel broadened after the entrance was
passed, and inclined upward, making more than
one turn. The floor was smooth, and although
I could not discern even the girl&rsquo;s form before
me, we made good progress. On and up we went,
and the unusual exertion was making me pretty
short of breath when a ray of light appeared
ahead. Ama made another run for the top and
we emerged abruptly upon the very crest of the
mountain, only a few hundred feet from the rift.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_312">312</div>
<p>The ridge was not very wide and we could look
down both sides of the mountain from where we
stood. There was no time for admiring the view,
however, for Ama hurried me along until we came
to where Ampax and his men were laboring. They
had already driven a hole into the big neck of
rock connecting the fragment with the mountain&mdash;it
looked much bigger here than from below&mdash;but
I could see it would have taken them a long time
to have done the job in their own way.</p>
<p>From below came the wild cries of the attacking
savages, mingled with the sound of firearms as
our boys bravely opposed them. The Tcha uttered
no sounds as they fought, but they were none the
less terrible for that.</p>
<p>Approaching Ampax I asked him to drive a deep
hole with his bar in the hollow he had already made
in the neck of rock. He had no idea what I proposed
doing, but Ama ordered him to obey me,
and he did. The poor fellow was sweating from
every pore with his exertions.</p>
<p>I took the dynamite from the box and carefully
lowered it into the hole, attaching a fuse I had
found in the parcel. It was not a very long fuse,
but it must answer our purpose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_313">313</div>
<p>Just then the Itzaex retired for the second time,
being repulsed with great loss to both sides.
Mounting the big fragment I leaned over the edge
and called to Paul that all was ready. At once he
withdrew all the Tcha and our own boys from the
barrier, making them retreat to a safe distance.
The scene of conflict, as I now viewed it, was a
veritable slaughter-pen, the dead and dying lying
heaped in every direction. It was surely time for
a diversion.</p>
<p>I ordered Ampax and his men to run along the
ridge, and told Ama to go with them. They were
slow to understand me and I could not wait long
for them to get out of the way because the Itzaex
were already forming for another rush. So I
lighted the fuse and ran from the place so fast
myself that the miners took warning and hastened
after me. Seizing Ama&rsquo;s arm I dragged her along
the ridge until the explosion knocked us all flat
upon the rocks and sent three miners flying over
the precipice.</p>
<p>The crash that followed the detonation shook
the ridge again, and then a hearty cheer went up
from the exhausted Tcha who stood below in the
valley. I knew then that the pass was blocked
and the battle over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_314">314</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE HEAR STRANGE NEWS</span></h2>
<p>Paul told me afterward that the advancing
Itzaex had reached the barrier and, astonished at
finding no opposition, were climbing upon it in a
closely packed mass when the great rock fell. The
slaughter must have been terrible, for not only
did the fragment completely fill the vast space but
the rubble of loose rocks following it killed many
on both sides. Among the victims were Datchapa
and his palanquin bearers, and being now without
a leader the superstitious terrors of the Itzaex,
who had always feared this &ldquo;sacred mountain,&rdquo;
influenced them to abandon further hostilities and
return to their own city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_315">315</div>
<p>When she counted the cost of the defense, however,
the brave High Priestess was in despair.
Many of the noblest and best citizens had perished,
and between war and earthquake the population
of the valley was now reduced to a mere handful,
and those mostly priests, women and children.
There were enough men left, however, to cause the
girl a still greater anxiety than she had yet endured,
as we soon discovered.</p>
<p>The task of disposing of the dead was immediately
undertaken by the artisans, miners and
agriculturists, of whom more survived than of the
higher castes. This was necessary in order to
prevent a plague, and by Ama&rsquo;s direction all the
bodies were taken to a large cave at the north of
the valley and therein deposited, after which the
opening was hermetically sealed.</p>
<p>The Priestess sent word to Katalat to perform
the burial service at the cave, but he returned no
answer and appointed an inferior to attend to the
obsequies. Hearing of this Ama dispatched a
messenger requesting the High Priest to attend
her at once; but he disregarded the order.</p>
<p>This conduct was so unusual, so rebellious and
exasperating that the High Priestess became very
angry and ordered the Waba Pagatka to seize
Katalat and bring him to her presence. The Captain
respectfully bowed, but said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_316">316</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not be able to do that, your Highness.
Strange tales have been told our people by the
High Priest, and these tales have inflamed the
populace against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Against me&mdash;the High Priestess of the Sun,
the Supreme Ruler of the Vale of Tcha!&rdquo; she
exclaimed, indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, your Highness,&rdquo; was the calm response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Paul, who was present, &ldquo;it is even
more necessary than before to arrest this rebellious
priest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pagatka remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as I command you, Waba,&rdquo; said Ama.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My men will not obey me,&rdquo; he returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the army in revolt, then?&rdquo; inquired Chaka.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the valley is in revolt against the High
Priestess,&rdquo; declared Pagatka. &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he
added; &ldquo;I do not believe the tales myself; but the
people all side with Katalat, and I alone am powerless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked what the tales were, the captain
would not say, so finally Ama dismissed him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_317">317</div>
<p>Then she turned to us a white and startled face
and asked if we knew anything of the matter; but
of course we were as ignorant as herself. Nor
were any of the priestesses wiser than their mistress.
While Ama had been secluded in her palace,
from whence she strove to issue orders for the
disposal of the dead and the welfare of her stricken
kingdom, old Katalat had taken advantage of the
people&rsquo;s despair and grief to rouse them to rebellion
against the girl. It did not surprise us much;
we had sized up this fellow correctly from the
very beginning.</p>
<p>One of the priestesses had a brother who was
an intelligent and faithful youth, and proposed
sending him out to gain information as to what
conspiracy was going on. Ama caught at the
suggestion and the boy was sent on his mission.</p>
<p>He returned in little more than an hour with
the information that Katalat had called a meeting
of the Tcha at the theatre for that very morning,
and already the citizens were flocking to the
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also will go,&rdquo; announced the High Priestess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_318">318</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better not, Ama,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;Let our party
of men go instead, and return to you with news
of what Katalat proposes to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she returned positively; &ldquo;they might prevent
your return, these lawless ones. I cannot
understand it at all, my friends. Ever have the
Tcha been a loyal and law-abiding people until
now. It is their duty to obey me, as their hereditary
Supreme Ruler, descended from the first Ama
who ever reigned in this valley. That Katalat
should dare defy me is not so strange as that my
people support him in his rebellion. Have I not
done my full duty in these trying times? Can anything
be justly urged against me? But even so I
am supreme in the Vale of Tcha! My word is as
powerful as the law itself, for it <i>is</i> the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was getting angry, and I did not blame her
much. But it was time for us to start for the
theatre, if we were to take part in the meeting
that had been called, so we waited for Ama to
arrange her robe of state&mdash;feminine fussiness being
the same in every country&mdash;and then all followed
her in a procession to the theatre, her thirty
priestesses forming an imposing train in our wake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_319">319</div>
<p>The theatre was two-thirds full when we arrived,
and I think those present represented about
all the able-bodied population remaining in the
valley&mdash;some four or five hundred, all told. Misfortune,
desolation and ruin had told upon their
iron nerves at last and deprived them of their
boasted self-control, for as we entered the place
only scowling faces greeted us.</p>
<p>On the platform, in full view of the audience,
stood Katalat. At his left the aged members of
the Tribunal sat in a row upon their golden bench.
I think they were all surprised at the sudden entrance
of the High Priestess, and the Tribunal
especially became visibly agitated; but the High
Priest merely cast a cold glance at the girl and
thereafter ignoring her presence began an address
to the people.</p>
<p>Ama flushed and her eyes flashed. Mounting
the steps of the platform she took her stand proudly
beside Katalat, reading the countenances of the
people as she faced them. Our party remained in
a group at one side, midway between the stage
and the audience. The Virgins of the Sun sat
upon the lower tier of benches, wonderingly regarding
the scene.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_320">320</div>
<p>&ldquo;People of Tcha,&rdquo; began the priest, &ldquo;I have
called you here to confer with me upon a very important
matter&mdash;a matter that affects your lives
and future welfare&mdash;a matter that has caused the
death of hundreds of your relatives and friends
and laid your fair city in ruins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A murmur of anger ran through the assemblage,
but Katalat raised his hand and silenced it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our laws are centuries old,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;and
they are so wise and just that we have always
prospered in obeying them. One of our principal
laws is that the legitimate daughter of the High
Priestess, descended in a direct line from our first
Ama, shall rule supreme in our beautiful valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every eye was now turned upon the girl, and
I was puzzled to understand why the rebellious
priest should have rendered her this tribute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until a few weeks ago,&rdquo; continued Katalat,
&ldquo;peace and comfort reigned in the Vale of Tcha.
We were enjoying the reward of ages of honest
labor and obedience to the laws of our race. Then
there descended upon us these strangers.&rdquo; Here
his eyes flashed upon us wickedly, and another
vicious demonstration broke from the crowd,
which was quickly suppressed by the speaker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_321">321</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then began our misfortunes,&rdquo; said the priest.
&ldquo;Our mother, Ama, whom we had all revered and
trusted, fell under the evil influence of these vile
foreigners. She saved three of them from the
sacrifice and made them all her friends, favoring
them above her own subjects. They were constantly
admitted to her palace, where men are not
allowed except to discuss important matters of
state with the Ruler. I admit that our Ama counseled
with these strangers day by day, disregarding
the advice of her faithful priests and her
Tribunal, and so bringing countless disasters upon
us. By our laws any outsiders who dare intrude
upon the Tcha must be put to death; yet Ama has
made them her friends and counselors. You know
the result. Death and desolation for our people
and honors and preference for our enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another burst of rage greeted this tirade, but
now the High Priestess stepped forward and held
up her hand with a regal gesture that quelled the
tumult as if by magic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_322">322</div>
<p>&ldquo;People of Tcha,&rdquo; said she in her clear voice,
&ldquo;you listen to lies and to evil suggestions. These
strangers have defended you from harm even
when you sought their death. Their power alone
saved you from the Itzaex invasion; twice have
they saved the life of your Ama. Shall we be
ungrateful for this? Shall we let unreasoning
anger make us inhuman beasts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white strangers are intruders!&rdquo; cried
Katalat fiercely, as if fearing the influence of her
argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;How many of you
have heard your mothers say that whenever a
white stranger finds a way to enter this valley he
will become the saviour of our people and the master
of our race? The prophecy has been handed
down from generation to generation, and at last
it has been fulfilled. This man,&rdquo; here she pointed
to Paul, &ldquo;the leader of those you call intruders,
but yesterday saved our race from annihilation;
therein has he become our saviour.&rdquo; Now she
drew herself up proudly as she continued with
sparkling eyes: &ldquo;And he is to be my chosen husband,
thus becoming the master of us all, as the
prophecy saith. Citizens and subjects I call upon
you all to honor this man!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_323">323</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so!&rdquo; shouted Katalat, raising a clenched
fist. &ldquo;I declare that this man&rsquo;s evil arts brought
upon us the earthquakes. Never have we suffered
such disasters until the strangers came among us,
encouraging our High Priestess to disregard the
laws and rob our mighty and glorious god of his
rightful sacrifices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will disregard the law no longer,&rdquo; said Ama,
turning suddenly upon the priest. &ldquo;Any disrespect
to the Supreme Ruler of the Tcha is by our
law severely punished. Waba Pagatka, I order
you to arrest this false and rebellious priest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain glanced toward Katalat, but did
not move to obey. Advancing a step the priest
said in an impressive voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had the Supreme Ruler of the Tcha issued
that order, the Waba Pagatka would at once execute
it. But this girl is not our Supreme Ruler&mdash;she
never has been!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This assertion fairly took Ama&rsquo;s breath away.
It even made me gasp, and Paul&rsquo;s eyes seemed
about to pop out of their sockets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_324">324</div>
<p>&ldquo;Explain your statement, sir!&rdquo; cried the High
Priestess, quickly recovering herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;The explanation is due
to all the people, and should have been made before.
You will all remember that ere I became a
priest I kept the historic Records of our Library,
wherein is written on imperishable parchment
every incident that transpires in our valley. In
reading these records years ago I discovered an
important secret. Our former Ama was childless.
She had no daughter to succeed her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A murmur of astonishment came from the assembled
people. The girl facing them never
flinched a muscle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fearing she would be condemned and hated
for her failure to supply a successor to the long
line of hereditary rulers,&rdquo; continued Katalat,
calmly, &ldquo;the High Priestess secretly took a child
of one of her former priestesses into her palace
and proclaimed the infant as her own daughter.
When she died, some five years ago, the girl who
now stands beside me&mdash;the fraudulent substitute&mdash;took
her place, and none suspected the imposture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_325">325</div>
<p>&ldquo;For myself, I had taken an oath to keep silent
unless some act of the false Priestess imperiled
the welfare of the nation. In protecting these
invaders, our natural enemies, and so bringing
upon us the wrath of our justly incensed god, the
destruction of our city and the death of hundreds
of loyal subjects, this girl has indeed released me
from my oath. At last you know the truth&mdash;that
there is no hereditary High Priestess now living
to rule over you, and that therefore her power
and supremacy devolve upon me, the lawful High
Priest of the Sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That last statement impressed me with the belief
that the man was lying. So evidently thought
Ama. She drew a breath of relief and actually
smiled into the stern faces confronting her&mdash;a
dazzling, brilliant smile that should have won her
case then and there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have listened, my subjects, to this false
and absurd accusation,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now I ask
you to demand from Katalat the proofs of his
assertion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_326">326</div>
<p>&ldquo;The proofs have been submitted to the Triumvirate,
to the Counselors and to the Waba
Pagatka,&rdquo; was the quiet rejoinder. &ldquo;In the Book
of Records is the signed confession of our last
High Priestess and a copy of the oath she obliged
me to take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the aged Triumvir arose from his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen and examined the Book of Records,
and I testify that the statement of the High Priest
is true,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also vouch for the truth of the statement,&rdquo;
said another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; added the third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any citizen should still doubt me,&rdquo; continued
the priest, &ldquo;the record will be shown to him. I
have no personal enmity against this girl, who,
alas, is now nameless. It was my duty to expose
her at this time and I have done so only to promote
the future welfare of the Tcha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ama, who had stood proudly erect until now,
suddenly reeled and would have fallen had not
both Chaka and Paul leaped upon the platform
and supported her. As they led her away Katalat
smiled his evil smile and turned to Pagatka.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrest those intruders and confine them securely
in the House of Seclusion,&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_327">327</div>
<p>&ldquo;If he tries that dodge we&rsquo;ll paralyze him!&rdquo; I
shouted, angrily.</p>
<p>But the waba advanced calmly toward us, and
a file of his men followed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, boys; let&rsquo;s beat a retreat,&rdquo; whispered
Paul. &ldquo;We must get Ama back to her palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We turned to obey, Paul and Chaka going first
and hurrying the half fainting girl between them.
Ned and Archie backed them up, with Nux and
Bryonia just behind. Pedro had no electrite, so
Joe and I took charge of the rear.</p>
<p>I had scarcely taken three steps when the waba
leaped forward and seized my arm. Whirling
around I flashed my electrite and tumbled him into
a heap. But the current spread and shot far beyond
Pagatka, catching unawares old Katalat as
he stood grinning on the platform. He threw up
his arms and made a dive into the arena, where
he lay as one dead.</p>
<p>A roar of fury burst from the throng. Every
able-bodied man present sprang from his seat and
rushed toward us, and so bitterly were they incensed
that I am sure they would have torn us to
pieces could they have laid hands on us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_328">328</div>
<p>But we fought a good fight, keeping them off
with our electrites while we beat an orderly retreat
toward the city. The powerful electric
charges stunned them by the dozens, and more
would have suffered had not the Tribune called
aloud for them to desist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them go! Let them go!&rdquo; I heard one of
the old men cry. &ldquo;They cannot escape from the
valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Believing this to be true, the Tcha held back,
for they were not especially anxious to be knocked
senseless and they knew from experience that our
weapons, although not deadly, were very effective
at close range.</p>
<p>So we gained the temple enclosure and Ama&rsquo;s
palace without further trouble; but no sooner were
we inside the building than it was surrounded by
the ranks of the Tcha. They camped there, too,
as if they had no intention of going away until
they forced us to surrender.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_329">329</div>
<p>Ama&rsquo;s apartments were at the front of the palace
on the second floor, at the end of a narrow hallway.
When we had securely barricaded the door
into this hall we were shut off from communication
with any other part of the building. Two of
the priestesses had entered with us to wait upon
their mistress, and when Ama had retired to her
chamber, sobbing as if broken hearted, we took
possession of the big reception room and prepared
for defense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, though,&rdquo; said Paul gloomily.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to give in sooner or later. If only
we had our gas-jackets it would be a different
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have one,&rdquo; returned Chaka significantly.</p>
<p>Yes; we had one. Joe was wearing it to-day,
for we had made it a rule that some one of the
party should wear the extra jacket constantly, to
use in case of emergency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ama must be saved,&rdquo; remarked Paul, with
decision. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that cowardly priest&rsquo;s
story. I am quite sure he forged that record to
ruin the girl and give himself supreme power.
But the Tcha believe him and they will be sure
to do Ama some mischief if she remains here, because
she had been our friend, if for no other
reason.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_330">330</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; I agreed. &ldquo;But the gas-jacket
won&rsquo;t carry two very far, as we know, and the
girl can&rsquo;t very well go alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allerton was thoughtful for a moment. Then
he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chaka is a little too heavy for this task, as
has been proven. We must select the lightest of our
party to carry Ama away to the <i>Seagull</i>, where
Captain Steele will take good care of her. One
of you three boys&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe&rsquo;s the lightest,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are, Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not going,&rdquo; I declared. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t weigh a pound more than I do, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t argue, Sam,&rdquo; exclaimed Allerton, sternly.
&ldquo;This is not a matter of choice, but of necessity.
You must be far lighter in weight than any
of us, and I command you to save Ama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s lots of time to decide,&rdquo; I returned.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all safe enough in this fortress
for the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took this for an admission that I consented;
but I had not the slightest intention of
deserting my comrades for the sake of a girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_331">331</div>
<p>We now began to examine our arms and equipment,
to see how much fight there was left to us.
In our storage belts were only a couple of dozen
charges for the electrites, all told. Some had four
or five, some less. There were extra belts in our
room in the wing of the priests&rsquo; palace, but we
could not get at them now. Our firearms were
in even worse condition. There were four shots
in Ned&rsquo;s repeating rifle and one in Paul&rsquo;s. Every
revolver was emptied but mine, and I had just one
cartridge to the good.</p>
<p>Not a very encouraging prospect for a party
hemmed in by a crowd of enemies eager for their
lives; but we must make the best of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_332">332</div>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE SETTLE AN OLD SCORE</span></h2>
<p>After three hours Ama came to us. She had
exchanged her regal robes for a simple white toga,
in which she appeared very charming in spite of
her reddened eyelids and trembling lips. She was
a brave girl, I willingly confess, and bore the
terrible blow as well as any woman could have
done.</p>
<p>Perhaps the bitterness of her disappointment
and chagrin was lessened by the thought that her
friendship for Paul had brought it upon her. Girls
like to make sacrifices for the man they love, I&rsquo;m
told. Repudiated and scorned by the people she
had so faithfully served, Ama naturally turned to
those who had stood by her in her trouble, and
she must have known that every one of us was a
faithful friend and devoted to her cause.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_333">333</div>
<p>Chaka&rsquo;s conduct filled me with admiration.
With all his heart and soul he loved this beautiful
girl; yet when he saw that &ldquo;his brother Paul&rdquo;
loved her, too, and that Ama turned more readily
to Allerton than she did to him, he had never faltered
in his steadfast affection for them both. The
girl&rsquo;s admission in the theatre that she would
accept Paul as her husband settled Chaka&rsquo;s chances
for good and all, and he never whispered or wavered
an eyelash. He was a savage, this handsome,
dignified young fellow, born in savagery
and even yet only half civilized. I wish there were
more civilized whites as noble as he.</p>
<p>Ama was able to discuss the day&rsquo;s events with
a fair amount of composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart is aching and my head whirls,&rdquo; she
said pitifully; &ldquo;but one cannot die because an ungrateful
people has bitterly wronged her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may all die soon,&rdquo; remarked Archie,
gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all,&rdquo; said Ama, with a wan smile. &ldquo;When
you, my friends, have made your escape from this
valley, I will go out and deliver myself up to the
cruel vengeance of the Tcha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we escape?&rdquo; asked Allerton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_334">334</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can you not fly away, as you came?&rdquo; she returned,
as if surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not without our flying clothes,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;They were taken from us when first we arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they are here,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I had
them brought to me so I might examine them,
and discover the secret of their use. But it was
too puzzling; I was stupid and did not understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We listened to her with hearts beating high
with hope for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;here&rsquo;? Where are
these flying-clothes, Ama?&rdquo; inquired Paul in a
voice that trembled in spite of his effort to control
it.</p>
<p>She reflected a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were put in my wardrobe room. Come;
I will show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all followed her through the gorgeous suite,
extensive and magnificent enough for any queen,
and at the end of a passage came to the room she
had described. The gas-jackets were piled neatly
upon a shelf, and with them were the cases containing
the themlyne crystals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_335">335</div>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost sure that was the happiest moment
of my life. I felt like kissing everybody all
around&mdash;even including Ama and her maidens.
But none of us did anything so foolish and we
accepted our good fortune like philosophers.</p>
<p>When we had carried the treasure back into
the big reception room I noticed that Paul sat in
a corner with Ama and held a lengthy conversation
with her. He also held her hand, even
though she needed no support at that time. Chaka
gazed silently from the window, and thinking that
perhaps the interview was of a personal nature we
none of us interrupted the conversation, although
after an hour or so the wait began to be tedious.</p>
<p>They finally came to us, however, hand in hand,
and both their faces were radiant with bliss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ama is coming with us,&rdquo; announced Paul;
&ldquo;for whether Katalat&rsquo;s story is true or not the
Tcha believe him and this is no place for Ama
hereafter. She will wear the extra gas-jacket and
I&rsquo;ll take care of her myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chaka approached and shook the hands of both
very warmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_336">336</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will be happy, and I am glad,&rdquo; he remarked
simply, and the poor fellow was not to
blame if his smile was a little sad and wistful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When shall we start?&rdquo; I asked abruptly, to
change the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once,&rdquo; replied our leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry we didn&rsquo;t get more rubies,&rdquo; said Archie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a few in my pocket yet, but most of them
I left in my room over there,&rdquo; indicating with a
jerk of his thumb the palace of the priests.</p>
<p>Ama turned to him. &ldquo;I have many of the red
stones here, if you wish them,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will be very useful to us all in the world
I am taking you to,&rdquo; asserted Paul, being recalled
to the practical side of our undertaking. Perhaps
he had lost sight of the fact that Ama was
not the only treasure he desired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_337">337</div>
<p>The girl led us to another room of the suite,
a sort of storage place it seemed. Rubies? Well,
well! There were quantities of them, lying loose
in boxes or packed in stout sacks. All had been
selected for their size and purity as the personal
property of the Supreme Ruler. Ama bade us
take all we wanted, and between us we managed
to stow every stone upon our persons. They were
not so very bulky, after all; but their value would
make Paul independent for life and redeem his
old homestead, as well as repay us all for the risk
of this exciting adventure.</p>
<p>We fitted the extra gas-jacket to Ama and then
donned our own. There was some question as to
whether we had enough themlyne to carry us until
we reached the <i>Seagull</i>, so I offered to drop
down outside our old quarters, jump in the window
and secure the large case of crystals from the
chest. This was agreed to, and when we were
ready to depart Ama bade good bye to her two
faithful maidens and we went out upon a broad
balcony that faced the temple. The jackets had
already been partly inflated. We were roped together
again, Ama between Paul and Chaka, the
latter at the end of the string. I was left free for
the present, so as to alight at the wing as I had
proposed, but I took Ned&rsquo;s hand and when the
gas was turned on we all rose slowly from the
balcony and, flopping our wings, made our a&euml;rial
way over the ruins of the old temple.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_338">338</div>
<p>Cries of anger greeted us from the populace
who watched below, but we paid no heed to them.
I saw the poor Waba Pagatka sitting on a bench
with his head tied up in a bandage as the result
of his encounter with the electrite, and he didn&rsquo;t
seem sorry to see us get away.</p>
<p>A moment later, as we approached the priests&rsquo;
palace, I released Ned&rsquo;s hand, let out some gas
and dropped swiftly to the ground just beside the
wing. Scrambling through the window I unlocked
our supply chest and found the large case
of themlyne. That was all I dared take and I
leaped through the window and left more gas into
my jacket, that it might float me again. This
took a little time, of course, and my descent had
been marked by some of the people nearest the
building.</p>
<p>Before I could get away a big fellow rushed
around the corner and came straight at me. I
pulled my electrite and knocked him over. Another
followed and met the same fate. I was
now so buoyant that my toes scarcely touched the
ground; but I could not rise yet, and here was a
third Tcha after me. The electrite promptly
settled him just as old Katalat himself appeared,
running like a fiend to prevent my escape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_339">339</div>
<p>He was not afraid of the electrite, having had
one dose of it and knowing that it did not kill;
nevertheless I aimed it at the priest and pressed
the button. Nothing happened. The storage
battery had become exhausted.</p>
<p>The gas-valve was wide open. Slowly I left
the ground and soared upward, and at that interesting
moment Katalat grabbed my legs and
held fast, shouting lustily for help. I remembered
there was one cartridge left in my revolver.</p>
<p>I glanced upward and saw that my friends were
too far away to be of any assistance to me. A
dozen Tcha were rushing to help Katalat secure
me and his wicked eyes glared triumphantly into
mine as he held me in a vice-like grip.</p>
<p>There was no help for it. I got the muzzle of
the revolver against his ear and pressed the trigger.
With a cry he reeled backward and ended
his career for good and all. Next moment I was
in the air and out of danger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_340">340</div>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE WIN AND LOSE</span></h2>
<p>Passing the City of Itza, Chaka announced his
determination to rejoin his people and rule over
them as their lawful atkayma. Now that Uncle
Datchapa was dead he would meet with no opposition,
especially if his white brothers continued
their trip through the air and did not alight in the
city.</p>
<p>Paul protested loudly at first, but a whisper
from Ama, whose womanly intuition led her to
understand the situation, induced him to let Chaka
act as he desired. Their parting, as they embraced
in the air, was as affecting as it was novel,
and Ama graciously allowed Chaka to kiss her
hand by way of farewell. The atkayma handed
his electrite to Pedro and divided his rubies among
us all, saying he would have no use for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_341">341</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do not grieve for me, Brother Paul,&rdquo; said
the Maya, pleadingly. &ldquo;I am sure to be happier
in my own country, ruling my people, than in
your stiff and luxurious civilization. It&rsquo;s the
call of the wild, I suppose, and I am wise to heed
it. Think of me kindly sometimes, you and Ama;
but think of me as free and contented, leading
the chase and the wars against the Mopanes. And
now, farewell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He unfastened the rope from his belt, released
a portion of the gas from his jacket, and slowly
descended into the city. We waited long enough
to see him surrounded by the natives, who prostrated
themselves humbly before him, and then
resumed our journey.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>It was a tedious yet arduous trip, that flight
over Eastern Yucatan, for the wind was contrary
and we had hard work to make satisfactory progress.
There was no safety in alighting, so we
kept on as best we could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_342">342</div>
<p>The night was brilliantly lighted by the stars
and moon, and we were too excited to feel fatigue.
It was a marvelous experience for Ama, yet the
girl was not a bit afraid and endured the strain
as well as the stoutest of us.</p>
<p>By daylight we came to the seacoast, and proceeding
north, with a slight breeze in our favor
now, we presently sighted by the aid of Paul&rsquo;s
field glasses our handsome ship the <i>Seagull</i>. She
was standing in toward the shore from the open
sea, a proceeding followed daily by my father
ever since we had left him, so that he might be on
hand to assist us if we suddenly appeared along
the shore.</p>
<p>They were all considerably astonished when
they discovered us coming by &ldquo;air route,&rdquo; and it
was amusing to us from our elevated position to
observe them craning their necks to watch us.
Archie, when we were just over the deck&mdash;father
had stopped the engines by that time&mdash;mischievously
dropped a ruby that struck Uncle Naboth
plump on his bald head and made him whoop like
an Indian.</p>
<p>We landed safely on the dock, and oh, how glad
we were to feel the planks under our feet again
and be relieved from all anxiety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_343">343</div>
<p>Ama received a cordial greeting from both
father and Uncle Naboth, and was given the state
cabin. It was wonderful how quickly she adapted
herself to our ways, and pleasant to see her happiness
in her new experiences, which she enjoyed
by the side of Lieutenant Paul Allerton.</p>
<p>When we arrived in Havana, where we came
to safe harbor, Paul and Ama were quietly married.
We gave her a ruby necklace, hastily put together
by a clever Cuban goldsmith, as her wedding
gift. The bride and groom started at once
for a trip to the New Hampshire homestead,
where, after paying off the mortgages, Paul intended
to visit his family until obliged to rejoin
his ship at San Diego.</p>

of four miles upon a horse, and resulted in its
staggering as though stunned by some mighty blow, and

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
